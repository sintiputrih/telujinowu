So, in 2010, she started working for </span><i><span>New England Aquarium</span></i><span> as part of their high school program. Now, fast forward to over a decade later, she has earned herself a spot on the new iteration of the </span><i><span>Below Deck</span></i><span> franchise, </span><i><span>Below Deck Adventure</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Get to know this ocean girl better as this Oriana Schneps Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Oriana Schneps On Below Deck Adventure</b></h3><p><i><span>Below Deck</span></i><span>’s new spin-off, </span><i><span>Below Deck Adventure</span></i><span> was a little different. Although the plot followed the original, the show promised to go beyond the yachts and featured the decks and stews in more relaxed, loose environments. Meaning, steamy hookups were on the way.</span></p><p><span>Also, the show introduced fans to a new crew boarding the Mercury motor yacht, and our star, Oriana Schneps, was one of them.</span></p><p><span>Recalling the filming process, Oriana shared that it was “seriously the best, worst, most exhausting, most humiliating, and the most exhilarating thing [she has] done thus far.” The star even labeled the experience to be a whirlwind but she was thankful for every second of it.</span></p><p><span>Joining Oriana for the inaugural season of </span><i><span>Below Deck Adventure</span></i><span> were her co-stars — Captain Kerry Titheradge, Faye Clarke, Lewis Lupton, Chef Jessica Condy, Kasie Faddah, Kyle Dickard, Nathan Morley, and Michael Gilman.</span></p><h3><b>Oriana Schneps Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Oriana Schneps garnered a net worth of under $400 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span>For those of you interested, a stew on </span><i><span>Below Deck</span></i><span> made around $5,000 a month, and up to $50,000 per charter season. So, this was probably what she got paid.</span></p><p><span>This </span><i><span>Below Deck</span></i><span> star started her journey back in 2010 (when she was just 15) working for </span><i><span>New England Aquarium</span></i><span> as part of their high school program. That year the aquarium launched a new program to teach inner-city kids how to scuba dive and 10 students were selected to be part of this coveted experience. Fortunately, Oriana was one of them.</span></p><p><span>So, during their trip, Oriana conducted different marine studies and surveyed the coral reefs. And it was this very experience, that would decide the entire trajectory of her life.</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, she went on to work as a chief stewardess/operations manager at </span><i><span>International Yachting </span></i><span>for almost 2 years. In August 2021, Oriana then finally earned a spot as a stew on a Mercury motor yacht featured in </span><i><span>Below Deck Adventure</span></i><span>, and the next year co-founded </span><i><span>Lazy 8ight Yacht Club</span></i><span>, an innovative blockchain company that builds generative 3D models of luxury mega yachts at scale, using blockchain technology.</span></p><p><span>Today, as of 2022, she works as a yacht broker at </span><i><span>United Yacht Sales</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Besides the yachting business, Oriana also has dabbled in accounting jobs thanks to her degree. So far, she’s been an account executive at </span><i><span>VaynerMedia</span></i><span> and</span><i><span> The Sasha Group</span></i><span> and a Senior Strategic Analyst at </span><i><span>String and Key</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>When Oriana wasn’t working, she enjoyed riding horses and scuba diving.</span></p><p><span>As for her education, Oriana graduated from</span><i><span> Hobart and William Smith College</span></i><span> with a 3.9 GPA and later got her BS in </span><i><span>Biomedical Management</span></i><span> degree from the </span><i><span>University of Massachusetts Amherst</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Does Oriana Schneps Have A Boyfriend?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Oriana Schneps has a boyfriend named John Dampeer. He was also one of the Charter Guests featured on </span><i><span>Below Deck Adventure</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>The duo often hung out at John’s wine-and-bear bar and restaurant, </span><i><span>Fool’s Errand</span></i><span>, located in San Francisco. And after filming the first season of the Bravo show, the pair went on a yacht trip to Croatia.</span></p><p><span>According to Oriana, her boyfriend is a 10. But although he’s a lot taller than her, she wishes he could be even taller.</span></p><h3><b>Is Oriana Schneps On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>oriana_schneps_</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here are her Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>oriana.schneps</span></a><span>, TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>orianafrombelowdeck</span></a><span>, and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>BoredYachtStew</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Oriana Schneps Age</b></h3><p><span>Oriana Schneps was 28 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>Below Deck Adventure</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She was one of the younger cast that season.</span></p><h3><b>Oriana Schneps Family</b></h3><p><span>Oriana Schneps comes from a family of four.</span></p><p><span>Her father, Matt Schneps is a Ph.D. physics graduate of </span><i><span>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span></i><span> who went on to spend almost 35 years as the executive director of the </span><i><span>Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span></i><span>. Now (69 years of age in 2022), he serves on the board of advisors at </span><i><span>Boston Children’s Museum</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for Oriana’s mother, Randy H. Goodman is a Photojournalist and photographer who worked for TIME and was given exclusive access to photograph Ayatollah Khomeini while wearing a borrowed head-to-toe chador. She was most popular for the exhibit of her Iran work, and her&nbsp; Iran photographs have been widely published in newspapers and magazines throughout the world including The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The L.A. Times, The Washington Post, and TIME.</span></p><p><span>Mentioning Oriana’s siblings, she has a younger brother named Robert Goodman-Schneps. He is the founder of </span><i><span>On Board Boston</span></i><span>, an organization dedicated to teaching youth resilience, empowerment, and the importance of extended community through skateboarding. Also, he has worked as a Media Coordinator at </span><i><span>Bright Horizons</span></i><span> and Account Coordinator at </span><i><span>Small Army</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Oriana Schneps From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Oriana hails from Cambridge, MA., right outside of Boston.
