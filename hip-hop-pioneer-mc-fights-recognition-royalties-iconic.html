It was here at this party that many hip-hop experts say the genre was born.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">La Rock claimed he got on the mic at the party, making him the first MC of hip-hop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2130d49b-c14a-4538-904c-1d99e80d8469/coke-la-rock-gty-jt-230803_1691084514270_hpMain_4x5.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">La Rock would continue to perform at subsequent parties and underground shows and claimed during that time he coined lines and phrases that many now associate with other artists.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">For example, La Rock said he came up with the lyrics, "You rock and you don't stop," from being on the mic at a party and watching people bounce to the music.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">It's a phrase often associated with the Afrika Bambaataa and Soul Sonic Force's 1982 song, "Planet Rock."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">He also told a story of how he says he came up with the track, "Hotel, motel, you don't tell, we won't tell," part of which was immortalized on the first Sugarhill Gang single "Rapper's Delight," often considered one of the first mainstream hip-hop tracks.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">La Rock believes he deserves formal credit on those singles.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"If Herc is the father of hip-hop... everybody knows that, if Herc came out of there and I picked the mic up and I came out of there. Why am I not known for that?" La Rock told ABC News Live. "Where's the royalty money of this?"</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">La Rock's pleas are not going on deaf ears as attorneys and other hip-hop legends are working to find ways to get those pioneers the recognition and money they deserve.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lita Rosario-Richardson, an attorney who specializes in music rights for hip-hop artists, told ABC News Live that the first question that she would ask La Rock is if he ever recorded any of his rhymes from that time.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">She said she saw in interviews that La Rock claimed to have made mixtapes from that time.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"If he recorded some of those lines on those 8 tracks, he has some evidence of when they were created," Rosario-Richardson, a partner at the firm Schulman Rogers, told ABC News Live.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a907ecb0-286f-467f-9d9f-30044c2cb76d/coke-la-rock-dj-herc-gty-jt-230803_1691084659974_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">And even if he didn't at the time, Rosario-Richardson contended that he can actually record his famous rhymes now and file them at the copyright office.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Because copyright exists from the date of creation – not from the date that you file your copyright registration," she explained.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Royalties can continue to be paid or money can continue to be earned for a time period equal to the life of the last surviving coauthor of the work plus 70 years," she added.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">La Rock recently visited an art exhibit in Soho that included a flyer and pieces of paper from the 1970s advertising DJ Kool Herc and Coke La Rock's Live performances. He's hopeful that sort of evidence may have the potential to help solidify his claims on the impact he made on hip-hop.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"It's certainly evidence," Rosario-Richardson said. "It's evidence that [he] and Kool Herc… were out there doing this. It sets up a date. It doesn't answer the ultimate fact, but it's certainly evidence that contributes to the point."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">When ABC News shared Rosario-Richardson's advice with La Rock, he seemed optimistic that it was a step in the right direction towards firming up his legacy for his family.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"It makes you feel good because…it's really for my grandkids' kids to be on and just to know the truth," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/252d1894-c445-469e-9d82-192713d9e9ff/chuck-d-gty-jt-230803_1691084871685_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Some veteran hip-hop legends have also taken matters into their own hands.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The Hip Hop Alliance, a non-profit created by veteran artists including Chuck D and Kurtis Blow, has created resources to provide the elder hip-hop artists who are financially struggling.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We've been part of industries that have made billions of dollars, OK. Where's the retirement fund? Where's the health care? You know, what's the advice and the direction for artists that come in?" Chuck D told ABC News Live.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/0f59b905-8b9d-40cf-9b3d-215394ef2ad8/kurtis-blow-gty-jt-230803_1691084994725_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Kurtis Blow said the group's non-profit "Legends Fund" has been providing emergency funds directly to those artists.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">"We're out to make people live their lives more abundantly and not just survive, but to thrive," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCRza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqGhoGK1sLyMqaCoppWav265wmadop%2BYqcBuvsScpqCmmam2sLqMq6aymZyptqa%2FjKKaqKaZmHy0wM6rsHihlHJ%2BcX2YcWhya2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-far-away-does-ring-detect-motion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How far away does Ring detect motion?">&larr;
