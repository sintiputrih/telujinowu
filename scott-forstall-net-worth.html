USA, and is a software engineer, best known to the world as one of the members of the software development team for the iPhone and iPad. His career started in the early ‘90s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Scott Forstall is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources it has been estimated that Forstall’s net worth is as high as $40 million, an amount earned mostly through his career as a software engineer. Also, he is a Broadway producer, and has co-produced musicals “Fun Home” and “Eclipsed” with his wife, which has also improved his wealth.</p><h3>Scott Forstall Net Worth $40 Million</h3><p>Scott is the middle child of Jeanne, a registered nurse, and engineer Tom Forstall. From an early age, Scott started expressing talent for programming, and as a result he qualified for advanced-placement science and math programs in his junior high school. During the program, he was learning programing on Apple IIe computers.</p><p>Thanks to his skills, he moved forward a year, and enrolled at Olympic High School in Bremerton, Washington, and slowly advanced and achieved 4.0 GPA, which is regarded as an impressive result, earning valedictorian honors, which he shared with another classmate, Molly Brown, who later became his wife. After high school, Scott became a student at Stanford University, from which he graduated in 1991 with a degree in symbolic systems, then continued with his education and the following year obtained a masters’ degree in computer science.</p><p>The same year he got his first job, becoming a part of Steve Jobs’s NeXT. After it was bought by Apple in 1997, Scott became chief of designing user interfaces for the Macintosh line. Three years later he was promoted to a lead designer of the Mac’s new Aqua user interface, and in 2003 became Senior Vice President. He also oversaw the creation of Safari, a web browser for Mac. Then in 2005 Steve Jobs started plans on creating the iPhone, and he co-joined the Macintosh and iPod teams, which were led by Scott and <a href=#>Tony Fadell</a>. The two sides actually became opponents, and Scott won the competition and as a result iOS was created. He stayed at Apple until 2013, after many successful creations, but was released from the company following the failure of his iOS 6.</p><p>After his departure from Apple, Scott didn’t make a public appearance until mid- 2015, when he announced his involvement in the Broadway productions “Fun Home”, which won several Tonya Awards, and then “Eclipsed”, something of a diversion from his career to that date.</p><p>Most recently he is reported to be working with the IT company Snapchat as an advisor.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Scott is married to Molly Brown, however, details about their marriage remain unknown in the media.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=3.5><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$40 Million</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>Washington, D.C., United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Washington D.C.
