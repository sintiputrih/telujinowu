We lent into Spring with a soft and muted palette across the day. Our civil ceremony was held in an old stone Barn against a backdrop of towering olive branches followed by a drinks reception on the sprawling lawns of our venue. We served Italian food for dinner in a simple sail tent followed by dancing in the Barn, which had been transformed into a disco complete with a huge disco ball overhead. It was without a doubt the happiest and most fun day of our lives.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMfgjw53HE8 data-wc=9><strong>Head to toe: can we have the outfit details?</strong></p><p id=enDJRpnq47Y data-wc=53>I wore a bespoke wedding dress that I designed with the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>OWN Studio</a>, paired with a veil from <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Fall</a>, which I had embroidered.

I have always wanted to get my dress made so that I could have my input on the design and be involved in the process. The designer, Valli, is a family friend, and it was an easy decision to work with her company and extra special that she was involved. The process took nine months from start to finish to ensure it wasn’t rushed but also allowed Valli and her team to perfect the dress and showcase their brilliant craftsmanship.&nbsp;</p><p id=eO7ITnGlQ7 data-wc=18>Something Blue - my something blue was a garter made by Valli and the team at Atelier Colpani&nbsp;</p><p id=eJDF2Yio4IV data-wc=40>I kept my jewellery classic and minimal - custom gold hoops (I’m always in hoops) and a necklace gifted from my Mother made in Dubai, and a beautiful gold bracelet ( my “something new” from one of my bridesmaids Charlotte).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fe920f938f0c-naomirichardwedding471.jpg><p id=ep68eyfgKj0 data-wc=7><strong>How did you decide on your outfit?</strong></p><p id=ezz-DY656Y_ data-wc=69>I had a strong idea in my mind for the type of dress I wanted for my wedding.

I had seen a Miu Miu dress, in this style which inspired my (fruitless) conversations with various wedding dress designers. Fortunately, a friend of a friend worked at Miu Miu and in time, Mrs Prada approved my “special order” of last season’s dress but in white with a train. My 5-year-old party dress was turned bridal with heavy pearl and crystal lattice embroidery.

I knew I didn't want to get married in a hotel – purely because I have a certain style and wasn't keen on working around a hotel's design that's normally more plush and traditional. I also knew I didn't want to get married outside because the UK weather is so unpredictable.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKTe5mfUkhP data-wc=68>Battersea Arts Centre (BAC) ticked a lot of buckets: it was a venue not used for many weddings (yet!) so had an element of surprise for our guests, was easy to get to, and was very unassuming from the outside. Indoors, the venue's ruined walls (there was a fire a few years ago) added character, and atmosphere, and stuck out to me as the perfect canvas to decorate.</p><p id=eH-lTd9uVZS data-wc=131>Once we locked in BAC I knew I wanted to keep the venue as the main feature, and not hide any of its superb interior with chandeliers or hanging decoration. I worked with our florist (Elspeth, from <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Blume Studio</a>) on choosing meadow-inspired flowers to reflect the English countryside, but also add a touch of luxury as, after all, it was a wedding. We placed candelabras across the tables, to which the flowers entwined, and had an abundance of candles throughout the venue. The grandness of the venue really did play its part on the day: the way the lights bounced off the walls throughout the evening and how the music sounded throughout the venue elevated the entire wedding – and the photographs really show how we brought the venue to life.</p><p id=eGhDGifBisX data-wc=9><strong>Head to toe: can we have the outfit details?</strong></p><p id=eFporZXYPmN data-wc=20>Dress: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Savannah Miller&nbsp;</a>via The Wedding Club, Shoes: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>NEOUS</a> via Net a Porter, Earrings: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Completed Works</a>, Veil: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Wedding Club</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e7e7e7d9dd23-louisaharryteaser028.jpg><p id=eAj8XASumOM data-wc=7><strong>How did you decide on your outfit?</strong></p><p id=ejh1af7yqLnN data-wc=54>There's no denying the choice of what to wear at your wedding is pretty vast. Having constant feeds on social media of different designers, styles, and trends can also be overwhelming. From early on I had a vision of exactly what I wanted to wear: a simple dress, a bold accessory and comfortable shoes.</p><p id=elkNI-i9eWi5 data-wc=48>I didn't care so much about my shoes; for me, dancing the whole night was my priority, and personally, I don't like the idea of shoving on a pair of trainers for comfort – so I wanted a simple pair of shoes that'll last me throughout the night.</p><p id=e2ztqO3HLT5P data-wc=87>I also wanted to feel like me on the day. That reflected in my hair and make-up too – instead of having a slick back or styled look, I chose to have my hair curled and left down. I now see why people have their hair up for weddings (the dancing can get sweaty!) but when I look at the photos of me dancing with all my friends and family, hair everywhere and make-up on the natural side, I'm happy to see that I look like me.</p><p id=eTJiq6HcMd9f data-wc=7><strong>Did you always want a traditional dress?</strong></p><p id=eDoVXAg3yORc data-wc=65>Absolutely; they say you go into wedding dress shopping thinking you know what you want to wear and then end up with something totally different. That wasn't the case with me: I found my dress easily because I knew I wanted something low-key, classic and a dress that I'd look back on in years to come and didn't regret buying or tied to a trend.</p><p id=epnZ4242ZclS data-wc=6><strong>How did your dress reflect you?</strong></p><p id=ereUCfoCMD6j data-wc=43>My dress reflects my own personal style – I always lean toward comfort over trends, but I do love to invest in accessories to elevate my look. I had actually bought the earrings I wore for my wedding before I found my dress.</p><p id=ep8RxPChAUfy data-wc=47>Day to day I tend not to wear anything too fussy; I'm a big admirer of understated clothing and more simple outfits with a pop of an accessory, so it was fun to bring my everyday style to my bridal look and take it up a notch.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h2 dir=ltr><br></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8Kuo62topp8dnyTbmlyZ2VisK2t0qygnGWSp7alsdJmpqdlp53GbsDHnrBmm5ikwKZ506Gcoqpdqb%2BisMitoKimkaF6uLHDnaCnn12Zv6a%2F0p6qaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./big-family-story-bluegrass-music.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big Family: The Story of Bluegrass Music">&larr;
