During a court hearing over the summer of 2021, the Gimme More hitmaker bravely admitted to a judge that she deemed the decade-long ordeal to have been “abusive.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spears would later reveal how her family allegedly kept her in a psychiatric facility against her will and often threatened her by saying that if she didn’t cooperate with their decisions, she would ultimately lose any chance of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">getting to spend time with her sons</a>, Sean and Jayden Federline.</p><p>The 40-year-old has always shared a close bond with her mom, but it goes without saying that being under a strict conservatorship where even her food was allegedly monitored, and she wasn’t allowed to have access to her own mobile device, one certainly wonders what other things happened behind closed doors while Spears obeyed the rules implemented by her own family.</p><p>Despite all, the Piece Of Me singer is still close to her children — perhaps even more now that she’s been freed from her conservatorship. Here’s the lowdown…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-britney-spears-cry-about-her-sons>Why Did Britney Spears Cry About Her Sons?</h2><p>In March 2022, Spears had taken to her Instagram page to gush about her relationship with her boys while sharing the sentimental side of motherhood as the teenagers are getting older.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Spears has mentioned not taking a huge liking to her sons maturing, telling her millions of fans on Instagram that she’s had to take a step back as her sons “don’t need me anymore,” she wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Britney Spears To Sit For Deposition On 'Child Safety And Drug Use' If Jamie Gets His Way</a></span></p><p>“I will just say it just like when my boys got bigger … IT LITERALLY SUCKS,” the Grammy winner captioned her Instagram photo as she stunned in a floral-printed black and red dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They [don't] need me anymore … I’ve cried oceans for my boys and I’m not lying!!!! Hopefully one day I can show recent pics of us but in the meantime, I respect their wishes!!!!”</p><p>The Someday vocalist, who is currently engaged to her longtime beau Sam Asghari, shares her two children with former backup dancer Kevin Federline, who she was married to back in 2004.</p><p>After three years of marriage, however, the two decided to call it quits. But from what’s been gathered, they’ve been able to effectively co-parent their kids without much hassle. It’s unclear, though, how much say Spears had when it came to her boys since everything had to be approved by her dad up until he was removed as her conservator.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-britney-receive-less-custody>Why Did Britney Receive Less Custody?</h2><p>Spears was outraged after a judge decided to reduce her custody from 50% to 30% following an altercation between Jayden and her dad Jamie.</p><p>The motion was set in place in September 2019, right around the same time Spears refused to head back on the road to front her latest Las Vegas residency.</p><p>She’s made it no secret that her children were often used as a way to get her to do things she didn’t want to do, such as performing when Spears really just wanted some time off and be with her boys.</p><p>So, after an alleged altercation between Jayden and Jamie, Spears saw her custody reduced, leaving her saddened and frustrated, a source told Us Weekly at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Britney hasn’t been spending time with her dad, and very much remains angry that she doesn’t have the boys as much as she did in the past,” the insider explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears In Talks With Piers Morgan For First Post Conservatorship Interview</a></span></p><p>“Jamie worries about her not having a set schedule for work that keeps her busy.”</p><h2 id=jayden-rsquo-s-revealing-ig-live>Jayden’s Revealing IG Live</h2><p>In 2020, Jayden appeared in a Q&A Instagram Live on his official page (which has since been removed) where he said he didn’t get along with his grandfather and that Spears had given the impression she wanted to quit music.</p><p>“Actually I haven't seen her doing a lot of music at all.
