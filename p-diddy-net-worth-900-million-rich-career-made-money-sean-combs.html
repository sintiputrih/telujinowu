While his pals Jay-Z and Dr. Dre have also earned themselves a spot at the top of the rap tier, Diddy certainly has managed to invest his earnings with music into what has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created him a $900 million net worth.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to launching his own record label, Bad Boy Records in 1993, scoring himself a debut album No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100, he later expanded into his very own clothing line, vodka company and television network,&nbsp;all of which have contributed to P Diddy's whopping net worth.</p><p>While he could easily sit back and let the zeroes expand in his bank account, P Diddy continues to work endlessly to this very day. From film and television appearances all the way to starring in his very own documentary, Diddy is certainly making the most of his money, time, and energy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all while being a father&nbsp;to six kids.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id=he-comes-from-humble-beginnings><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He Comes From Humble Beginnings</span></h2><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Combs</a> may be worth close to $1 billion, he was not always ballin' the way he is now! The rapper comes from extremely humble beginnings where he and his siblings were raised by their grandmother in Harlem, New York. Diddy's dad passed when Combs was only three years old, and his mother worked four jobs to support the family, so he and his sister did not see her all that often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-first-job-was-at-12-years-old><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>His First Job Was At 12 Years Old</span></h2><p>Diddy also began working at 12 years old! Although he didn't have an official job, since he was far too young to enter the workforce, he served as a newspaper delivery boy, doorman, and a lavatory attendant. Diddy began working at such a young age due to the fact that he hated seeing his mother's face whenever she couldn't provide for her family the right way, he said in an interview. His motivation for making money stemmed from the first deal he made with the legal paperboys, striking a deal with them to deliver their newspapers for them, and he'd give back half the money.</p><h2 id=he-founded-bad-boy-records-in-1993><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He Founded Bad Boy Records In 1993</span></h2><p>While delivering newspapers gained the rapper six routes in a matter of months, he knew he couldn't do that forever. By 1993, when P Diddy was 24 years old, his passion for music gained enough notoriety and success for him to create his very own record label. The star founded Bad Boy Records and while it had its mix of highs and lows, it never lost its footing. The label managed to do quite well for itself as time went by, and Diddy would soon find himself signing some major acts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=diddy-signed-major-musical-acts><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Diddy Signed Major Musical Acts</span></h2><p>After launching his own record label, Bad Boy Records, in 1993, P Diddy began his newest venture as a rap producer. When it came to signing artists, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diddy managed to score himself a few massive names such as Notorious B.I.G,</a> Faith Evans and Craig Mack, who would secure Diddy his first-ever major song on the Billboard Charts with Mack's "Flava In Ya Ear" in 1994, only a year after creating the label. After this point, there was no looking back for the rapper, and when it came time for Diddy to release an album of his own, it was game over for everyone else.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Pics That Change The Way We See P Diddy</a></span></p><h2 id=his-debut-album-went-straight-to-no-1><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>His Debut Album Went Straight To No. 1</span></h2><p>Sean Combs, who would soon adopt a number of different names such as Puff Daddy, Diddy and P Diddy, released his very own debut rap album in 1997 titled "Puff Daddy & The Family: No Way Out". Diddy's song&nbsp;I'll Be Missing You" was his very first single released off the album that not only gained massive success but debuted straight to number one on Billboards Hot 100 chart. The song, which stayed at No. 1 for 11 weeks,&nbsp;was a tribute to Notorious B.I.G who had passed that same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-owns-a-very-successful-clothing-brand><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Owns A Very Successful Clothing Brand</span></h2><p>While many people might think that P Diddy gained most of his money from music, he actually managed to gain a $900 million net worth from all of his side projects. Diddy came out with Sean John, his massively successful clothing lin, in 1998 and it instantly turned into an overnight success. The rapper holds fashion shows to debut the newest collections every year and has managed to secure nearly $600 million annually from the line alone.</p><h2 id=diddy-has-major-stakes-in-a-bottled-water-company><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Diddy Has Major Stakes In A Bottled Water Company</span></h2><p>In addition to having an uber-successful clothing line, Diddy is also a partner with Aduahydrate, one of the biggest bottled water companies in the world. The rapper backed up the company alongside actor Mark Wahlberg, with over $20 million. Considering how the company has since become the fastest growing bottled water company in the world, it is safe to say that the two have not only made their money back but have since become part owners of a company that is now worth $2 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">P Diddy: 15 Photos Of The Hip-Hop Icons Evolution</a></span></p><h2 id=he-also-owns-part-of-revolt-tv><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Also Owns Part Of Revolt TV</span></h2><p>It appears P Diddy is easily one of the most intelligent people when it comes to investing his cash. From his own record label, bottled water, clothing line and even his own television network. Diddy is a part-owner of Revolt TV, which focuses on pop culture and entertainment, and has a huge market with a number of social media platforms that have allowed Diddy to rack in millions per year.</p><h2 id=diddy-scored-his-very-own-documentary><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Diddy Scored His Very Own Documentary</span></h2><p>Considering just how crazy P Diddy's life has been, it is no surprise that he managed to score his very own documentary. In 2017, Diddy released "Can't Stop, Won't' Stop: The Bad Boy Story", which focused on Diddy's rags to riches story. Not only did he star in the documentary, but he also produced it. The 80 minute-long production earned Diddy a nimber of MTV nominations for Best Documentary and MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Music Documentary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Is How P Diddy Maintains His Wealth</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-got-his-very-own-line-of-vodka><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He's Got His Very Own Line Of Vodka</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>3 </span><span></span></h2><p>As if bottled water was not enough, P Diddy has also become the face and part-owner of Ciroc Vodka. Diageo, the creator of the vodka brand, made a marketing deal with P Diddy back in 2007 to push Ciroc as an "ultra-premium" vodka. According to The Financial Times, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diddy gets a complete 50-50 split of the profits from Ciroc sales</a>. This is a huge contributor to Diddy's net worth considering he has managed to increase revenues for the vodka company by a whopping 131% in the United States alone.</p><h2 id=he-is-a-judge-on-fox-s-the-four><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Is A Judge On FOX's 'The Four'</span></h2><p>If Diddy isn't creating music or investing in a number of products available across the globe, you can catch him on your television screens every single week! The rapper joined the panel of judges for the FOX singing competition "The Four". Considering Diddy is without a doubt one of the biggest names in the music industry, it would only make sense for him to a part of the show, which earns him quite a pretty paycheck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-has-made-several-movie-appearances><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Has Made Several Movie Appearances</span></h2><p>While Diddy himself does not consider himself an actor by any means, that has not stopped him from making cameos and taking on roles in a number of films. One of Diddy's most recognized movies is the comedy film "Get Him To The Greek" starring Russel Brand and Jonah Hill. Although his films don't make Diddy his million, it sure does help and we're certain that his bank account is just as happy regardless of the size of the role.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Stunning Photos Of The Women P Diddy Has Dated</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinZpyZmbG6ec2eq2avn6fBqXmYaWdmpZmhuaq7zWapopuYYrCivsSeqWalkZmybrnOp5yyZaOarq95wqikm6tf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeff-green-net-worth-154910.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeff Green Net Worth 2024">&larr;
