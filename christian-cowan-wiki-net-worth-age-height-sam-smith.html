Are they really dating? How old is Christian? What is his net worth? Details about his family members?</p><p>Find all of it here and more as you scroll down this article.</p><h3><strong>Meet Christian Cowan, Sam Smith Rumored Partner&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Sam Smith was spotted with NYC-based designer Christian Cowan which ignited the rumor that they are dating each other. According to DailyMail, he was photographed walking arm-in-arm with Cowan and giving him a smooch on the head. The Daily Mail published the pictures but omitted Cowan’s name, referring to him only as Smith’s “friend” in the intimate photos.</p><p>The Unholy singer and the designer appear to have recently gone to get tattoos together. An artist at Australia’s Markd Tattoos’&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an image</a> of the two and some pals on Monday getting inked. The artist wrote: “At first I didn’t believe it when I got an email saying that Sam Smith would like a tattoo from me. Even on the day, I thought it was just a hoax… One of my proudest moments as a tattoo artist!”</p><p>The ink is of a red plant. Although it is unknown how Christian and Sam initially became acquainted, they were pictured together in December 2022 at the White House for the signing of the Respect for Marriage Act alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden.</p><p>Sam has been rumored to be romantically publicly to a few including 13 Reasons Why star Brandon Flynn. They’ve also been romantically linked to Francois Rocci,&nbsp;Jonathon Zeizel,&nbsp;Charlie King,&nbsp;Jay Camilleri,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Andy Newton Lee&nbsp;in the past.</p><p>Sam addressed the link between their relationship and their music career saying, “A queer person’s first relationship is a huge thing sometimes because it’s where you discover the most about yourself. And so [the Love Goes alum is] more about me and my journey after that, really. But yeah, it is basically a break-up album.”</p><p>During the same interview with&nbsp;The Sun, Sam further discussed their sexuality.</p><p>“I generally have never really thought about people, any human beings, in rigid terms. I’ve grown up in a family where the gender power balance and all these things were completely shifted,” they explained. “My mum worked, and my dad was a househusband. My sisters are incredibly strong women.”</p><p>They also discussed coming out as non-binary and changing their pronouns to they/them. “It wasn’t a new feeling, it was just the discovery of a language and a community of people that felt the same way,” Sam added at the time. “It’s been lovely. It’s been a process of feeling heard and seen — that there is a space that I can live in and enjoy my life in and feel completely like myself, and be treated as such. I think that’s the difference with the pronouns.”</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Christian Cowan Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>As of 2023, designer Christian Cowan sits under a net worth of $1 million.</p><p>Christian is known as a trailblazer in fashion design and a voice for the LGBTQ community.</p><p>Following Nas’ sequined-viral moment at the 2019 VMA Awards wearing Cowan’s first-ever menswear ensemble, the two became friends and formed a partnership that harnesses the brand’s distinctive richness via Nas’ viewpoint.</p><p>Christian also worked with Swarovski first time on the over 400,000 crystals used throughout. He said, “Working with Swarovski has been a dream of mine for my entire career. When the Swarovski team asked me to collaborate with them for my latest collection, the sky was truly the limit for what they enabled me to design and envision. The crystals and elements used not only bring an incredible luxe feel to the pieces but also embody the spirit of the Christian Cowan brand; eye-catching, innovative, and iconic.”</p><p>Christian said he was inspired by various means of power, from natural and vivid to ritualistic and wealth. He explained some of the ways he chose to depict it: “Fireworks, which are a ceremonial aspect of power, and animal print, and ocelot, which is an animal-wear power.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-67 p Component-p-0-2-44">He’s also inspired by the powerful women who wear his designs. The designer counts Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, and Keke Palmer among celebrities who have embraced his designs. And then there’s Cardi B. Christian dressed the Grammy-winning recording artist for the cover of her debut album, “Invasion of Privacy.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-67 p Component-p-0-2-44">“To see them enjoying my work, and kind of fueling what they do, is always, like, an honor,” Cowan said.</p><p>In July 2020, Christian called out Khloe Kardashian for trying to sell his sample dress. The designer himself called the reality star out on social media but her&nbsp;camp claims she didn’t know it was a loaned dress. As noted by&nbsp;Page Six,&nbsp;Christian shared a screenshot of a dress on Khloé’s recent&nbsp;Kardashian Kloset&nbsp;resale listings. “@khloekardashian why are my runway samples I loaned you being sold on your website?” Cowan reportedly wrote on Instagram Stories. “We’ve emailed 3 times and had no response.”</p><p>Christian Cowan is a designer who&nbsp;founded his eponymous label in 2016.
