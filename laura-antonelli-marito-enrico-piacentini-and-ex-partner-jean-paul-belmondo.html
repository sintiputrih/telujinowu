Even after her passing, discussions about the late Italian actress’s marriage and divorced status continued.</strong></p><p>Known for her sexy parts in films, Laura Antonelli is a gorgeous Italian actress. She also starred in over 45 motion pictures between 1964 and 1991.</p><p>Fans have brought attention to Antonelli’s appearances in a number of acting projects, such as Malicious, L’Innocente, and Passion of Love.</p><p>Similarly, Antonelli’s career took off when she played the alluring part in Malizia 2000, Secret Fantasy, and Lovers & Other Relatives.</p><p>Laura portrayed Carmen Milkovich in the television miniseries Particularly Giulia. She also made appearances in six 1989 television programs.</p><p>Antonelli was a professional gymnast, teacher, and model in addition to her acting career. She also managed to acquire a Coca-Cola advertising in Italian.</p><p>On November 28, 1941, Antonelli was born in Pola, Istria, Italy—now known as Pula, Istria, Croatia.</p><p>Laura Antonaz was her birth name. Sadly, on June 22, 2015, she had a heart attack and died. In Ladispoli, Rome, Lazio, Italy, she passed away.</p><p>The most seasoned celebrity of her day was Antonelli. Mainly, her extraordinary beauty and acting prowess were what fans remembered her for.</p><h2>Encounter Laura Antonelli Piacentini Marito Enrico with his former partner Jean-Paul Belmondo</h2><p>Laura Antonelli and Enrico Piacentini exchanged vows. Piacentini, her estranged spouse, was a publisher once.</p><p>Celebrity Jean-Paul Belmondo and the Italian actress had an affair. Both were born between 1972 and 1980.</p><p>French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo was well-known. In the same way, he was linked to the 1960s New Wave.</p><p>Belmondo started working in 1953. Similarly, starting in the 1960s, he became a well-known French movie star and remained so for many years.</p><p>Additionally, he has well-known credits in the films Breathless, The Professional, Pierrot le Fou, That Man from Rio, and Borsalino.</p><p>Belmondo gained notoriety mostly for his appearances as police officers in action thriller movies.</p><p>He did, however, express a distaste for appearing in English-language movies. Hollywood actively courted Belmondo, but the actor turned down English films.</p><p>Belmondo, Laura Antonelli’s business partner, starred undeniable box office titans like Alain Delon and Louis de Funès. Over 160 million people watched the French megastar over his 50-year career.</p><p>Germano Randi is the name of Laura’s kid.

Her parents were from the now-Croatian Pula in Pola, Kingdom of Italy.</p><p>Her birthplace was Istria’s old capital. Laura’s parents left what was then Yugoslavia after the war.</p><p>Thus, the Antonelli family resided in camps for refugees in Italy. In the end, they made Naples their home.</p><p>Laura’s dad was an administrator at a hospital. In a similar vein, Antonelli had a childhood interest in mathematics.</p><p>But when she improved as a gymnast as a teenager, her priorities shifted.</p><p>Antonelli was a citizen of Italy. She and her family also moved around a lot.</p><p>Antonelli reminisced about her early years in an interview, saying:</p><p>When I was in my teens, my parents advised me to enroll in hours of exercise courses. They felt I was unimportant and awkward. It was their hope that I might at least become graceful.</p><p>My professional career began mostly in the rhythmic gym. It’s a dance of sorts, this.</p><p>Antonelli also gave up on her goal of becoming a mathematician. After graduating, she went on to work as a gymnastics teacher.</p><p>Rome became home to Antonelli. She worked as a gym instructor at a high school. Similarly, Antonelli encountered individuals in the entertainment business who reached out to her for modeling opportunities.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Italian actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Otelli Edwards Husband | Who Is The Anchor Married To</a></h3>Otelli Edwards worked as a News Anchor for Mediacorp, a Singapore-based media company, for 17 years.
