I was struck by how thoughtful and funny he was," she wrote.

Following the birth of Rowan, Brooke spoke openly about her severe battle with postpartum depression. <strong>"Having my first daughter obliterated me,"</strong> she wrote in her 2014 book, 'There Was a Little Girl'.</p><p id=eiZ2hGdEeLN data-wc=53>"It took away all my power. All of a sudden, I was experiencing something so foreign, which I had no response for. I had no resources to rely on. … And with the level of depression I experienced, I was just waiting to figure out how to slip away. It was so acute."</p><p id=eWTqi41bFp data-wc=66>Speaking about her relationship with her daughters – who largely remain out of the spotlight – in 2022, Brooke told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>: "I'm not a TikTok influencer, so evidently I don't exist. I'm not quite sure how to crack that one, but I am getting demands for things like curling irons and boy issues all day long, so I guess I feel like I've done something right."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZm5oYGqCd3vBq6aoo5ViwKm1xKWbrGWWlrqwwdJmn66rkpa7pXnCoamiq12dsq%2Bvx7JksKCfYra0eceeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./harley-jane-kozak.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harley Jane Kozak Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family">&larr;
