Although it applies for all time, he shared it amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p class=Zg><a class="zd d" href=#>Derek Hough</a>, 34, took to Instagram on Wednesday to remind his fans of how important it is to spend time with loved ones while they're still with us. He was inspired by a conversation he once had with his father.</p><p class=Zg>Derek and his dad, Bruce Robert Hough, appeared to have a close bond based on the clip and the caption that accompanied it. The post is found below.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Derek Hough attends the Premiere of Disney's "Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker" on December 16, 2019 in Hollywood, California. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>Derek and his dad talk</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>The video, which was about eight and a half minutes long, saw Derek ask his dad about his accomplishments and being a father. Bruce said while it wasn't an accomplishment, he was most proud of his kids.</p><p class=Zg>Bruce is also father to Julianne Hough, 31, who is a dancer like her brother. Both of them were on the popular competitive reality show, "Dancing With the Stars" as professionals.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>Siblings struggle together</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>Derek's still <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a27509289/julianne-hough-derek-relationship-upbringing/>making</a> his mark on "World of Dance" while Julianne enjoyed some time as a former judge on "America's Got Talent." The pair have reportedly been dancing together since before they were teens.</p><p class=Zg>When Julianne was 10 and Derek 13, they <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/derek-julianne-hough-open-up-about-how-their-challenging-childhood-shaped-their-success/>left </a>their Mormon home in Utah and endured a difficult time at the Italia Conti Academy â€” a dance school in London.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Dancer / TV Personality Derek Hough visits Hallmark's "Home & Family" at Universal Studios Hollywood on March 08, 2019. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>There, the two struggled with a challenging schedule, homesickness, and lack of care. One time, Julianna <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/derek-julianne-hough-open-up-about-how-their-challenging-childhood-shaped-their-success/>said</a>, "I got off at the wrong train station. I was just standing there thinking, 'Where am I?' "</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>Derek was bullied</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>As for Derek, his hardest times were during childhood, when he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/derek-hough-opens-childhood-bullying/story?id=26248960">was bullied</a> by his peers for being a dancer. In his memoir, "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion," Derek opened up about everything.</p><p class=Zg>He revealed that his mother instructed him to hit back at his peers, and he obeyed. Most of all, though, he learned to look towards his passion in the midst of his suffering.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>Don't judge others</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>Despite the fact that their parents got <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://countrymusicnation.com/derek-julianne-hough-perform-dance-about-the-pain-of-parents-divorce>divorced</a>, Derek's dad gave his son a lot of gems in the clip. He spoke about not judging people, especially when you don't know their situation.</p><p class=Zg>Rather, the father-son duo pushed for empathy and compassion. They also noted how time is short, and one should spend as much of it with loved ones while possible.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>A dance with mom</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg><a class="zd d" href=#>Earlier this month</a>, Derek did just that when he danced with his mother, Mari Anne Hough, in a cute video. Fans were enamored by the display, commenting on Mari's youthful looks and vigor.</p><p class=Zg>The family dog was also enjoying the energetic display, and fans loved him for it, too. Derek also has siblings Katherine, Sharee, and Marabeth. We hope they're all staying safe.</p><p class=Zg>We at AmoMama do our best to give you the most updated news regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, but the situation is constantly changing.
