Oh my!<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck9iuwhd700wf8oyewnm96ei0@published data-word-count=165>On Sunday evening, <a href=#>Stephen Sondheim</a>’s fans — both famous and not — gathered at their computers at 8 p.m. to celebrate the Broadway legend’s 90th birthday. And then they sat there for a long time because the Broadway.com live feed was delayed for half an hour or so, then briefly started, then saw its host Raúl Esparza’s audio cut out, and then stopped and rebooted half an hour after that. And then, once it started … it couldn’t be stopped. Stars from stage and screen — Streep! Patinkin! LuPone! Peters! Zien! — all paid tribute. They were doing so, in many cases, to a friend, to a mentor, to the man who had given them the roles of their lives. But for the rest of us, Sondheim is the hyperclever Bard of Loneliness, the writer whose music implies, in every note, that being isolated and confused can actually have its upside. That makes him not just the birthday boy but the man of the moment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck9iv23p2002w3c5qnbo6fe6y@published data-word-count=15><strong>Madison Malone Kircher: </strong>Okay, so, where should we begin?

Oh, me? Sure, I’ll start. I would die for Katrina Lenk. The acoustic cover of “Johanna” was both beautiful and original.

It’s all about assembling one moment from shattered places and times, somehow both a song about a moment lost to history and about what it’s like to try to comprehend the world right now from your laptop screen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck9iv2r89004b3c5qkihfx3t2@published data-word-count=65><strong>Bonanos:</strong> Completely. You know, I’ve seen Pacific Overtures staged only once, and it’s the one show of Sondheim’s that I never quite got. I also didn’t know at the time that Sondheim considered “Someone in a Tree” his best work, and even that song left me indifferent. But I think this performance, of all things, changed my mind. I finally got it this time around.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck9iv2r89004c3c5q9lbhjk1h@published data-word-count=50><strong>Shaw:</strong> I think in terms of emotional wreckage, I’m going to vote for Judy Kuhn doing “What Can You Lose?” Or maybe Victor Garber telling us that in the ’60s he was a folk singer in Canada, which makes … so much sense. Or Chip Zien embracing the baker’s hat!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck9iv2r89004d3c5q79a718ag@published data-word-count=81><strong>McHenry: </strong>In terms of song choice, Lea Salonga’s straightforward deployment of “Loving You” cut me, a Passion fan, straight to the bone. On a completely different emotional plane, it was a delight to witness Elizabeth Stanley revel in “The Miller’s Son.” There’s so much texture in a song like that, and it’s just fun to see someone unravel them (as opposed to something like Randy Rainbow’s “By the Sea,” which tried some wink-wink updates to the original&nbsp;— never wink-wink update Sondheim).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck9iv2r89004e3c5qe24bn5nk@published data-word-count=52><strong>Kircher: </strong>Stanley, we should probably note, pulled double duty and appeared over on GLAAD’s competing livestream with the cast of Jagged Little Pill.
