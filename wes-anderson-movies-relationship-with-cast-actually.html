Being on his movies can be seen as some kind of retreat, one where familiarity among cast and crew is as important as getting those perfectly centered long takes.</p><p>Across his ten movies — from his 1996 feature debut 'Bottle Rocket' to <a href=#>his latest and first anthology 'The French Dispatch'</a> — Anderson has managed to put together strong ensembles, casting some of the most recognizable faces in the industry alongside relative newcomers, all almost guaranteed to be seen in another of his projects at some point down the line.</p><p>As the Texan filmmaker has two more projects in the works, each starring a mix of Anderson veterans and first-timers, let's take a look at what the Wes regulars have said about his movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=frances-mcdormand-recognized-a-familiarity-between-wes-anderson-and-the-coen-brothers><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Frances McDormand Recognized A Familiarity Between Wes Anderson And The Coen Brothers</span></h2><p>Frances McDormand starred as Mrs. Bishop in 'Moonrise Kingdom,' lent her voice to Interpreter Nelson in animated film 'Isle of Dogs,' and recently appeared in 'The French Dispatch'.</p><p>The Oscar-winning star has looked back on first watching a film directed by Anderson and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">experiencing a sense of familiarity</a>.

Despite being really fond of that movie, Owen revealed his Wes Anderson favorite is actually 'The Darjeeling Limited,' in which he, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman play three brothers meeting in India.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I guess my favorite. I mean, I always have a soft spot for 'Bottle Rocket' — the first one — but then 'Darjeeling Limited,' he told 'Wired' in February this year.</p><p>"I think the story kind of about three brothers was something that, of course, I can relate to. And, I just love being in India."</p><p>After 'Bottle Rocket,' <a href=#>Wilson and Anderson co-wrote two other films together</a>, 'Rushmore' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums.'

Tilda Swinton was so moved by that spiritual journey through India that she penned Anderson a heartfelt letter after watching it.</p><p>"I saw 'Bottle Rocket' and I've seen each film since as it came out — in awe. After 'The Darjeeling Limited' in 2007, I wrote him a fan letter, to which he replied.

It was abstract at first. I didn't know if he wanted me to speak French or English; he said maybe both. I didn't know [there would be full-frontal nudity], I didn't understand, I think. I went with the flow — oh OK, I’ll get naked," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have no problem with nudity when it has a purpose.

He asked me not to share my thoughts on this with Timothée. However, I did. Timothée’s reaction was basically, 'Huh.' Our differing opinions didn't seem to change the outcome: Wes was able to convey his choice by having the sound of creaking bedsprings over a shot outside Krementz's bedroom door.

Except those involved just so happen to be some of the best actors in the business.</p><p>Brody likened his experience on the set of 'Asteroid City' in Spain to going to "an actors' summer camp".</p><p>"I like all my bunkmates, my mom's visiting me — she's been coming everywhere since 'Darjeeling.'

I mean if you did nine movies with Wes Anderson… people will call that a career," he shared with the 'i' paper last year.</p><p>As for what draws him back to an Anderson-helmed set, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Murray confirmed the legend of convivial sets</a>, where actors and crew work and dine together consistently.</p><p>"I keep coming back to the shared humanity of it," the 'Ghostbusters' star said.</p><p>"If we can live together, we can work together.
