His climb to the NFL was anything but traditional, originating from his playing days at Brandon High School in Mississippi, where he was not only a standout on the football field but also a state champion on the diamond as a catcher and&nbsp;hooper&nbsp;on the hardwood.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>College Football Career</h2><p>He started his college football career at Northwest Mississippi Community College, winning the NJCAA National Football Championship there. He later transferred to East Carolina and won the starting QB job after initially landing as the fourth quarterback on the depth chart. That drive and skill took him to Washington State, where he thrived in Mike Leach's Air Raid offense, setting season records for passing yards and completions by a Pac-12 Conference player and winning the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>NFL Journey</h2><p>Taken by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL draft, Minshewmania was born in his first taste of life in the NFL. Gradually trending towards stepping in as the team's starter, the quarterback earned the nickname "Minshew Mania" as crowd support began piling up and—following an injury to the starting quarterback—coloring the world in navy and teal. His personality, hard work ethic, and surprising success gained him legions of fans and turned him into a darling of the league.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Career and Achievements</h2><p>His NFL career has displayed all of those qualities and then some. Among other things, he established the Jaguars' franchise's rookie passing touchdown record before being traded to the Philadelphia Eagles and later the Indianapolis Colts and now this year with the Las Vegas Raiders. Those accolades are headlined by his first career Pro Bowl appearance as an alternate, and the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, and others.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Character</h2><p>Often lost amid his incredible mindset and character are Minshew's physical traits and on-field production. Observers took note of his impressive work ethic and sharp mind, which combined with many hours in the weight room have helped make him a rare undersized quarterback who can be effective in the NFL. Recognized for his tireless work ethic, knowledge of the game, and competitive drive, he has become a respected leader on and off the field. His&nbsp;attitude and mindset made him a fan and teammate favorite alike.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Overview</h2><p>The lesser-known path to the NFL that Gardner Minshew II traveled, from unheralded high school quarterback to NFL standout, serves as a testament to his resolve, ability, and unwavering moxie. His come up with the Jaguars and his subsequent rise epitomizes sportsmanship and the courage of the human spirit. Through a whirlwind of obstacles, Minshew has found his successful place in the NFL, becoming known and respected for his impressive skill set and larger-than-life personality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RfrLWmvsRmm6KcXZyus7DNnqlmpZmjwKmx1maaqKWVYrOzu8xmq6GdXaq7rbXKnqOyZZqkwrO6xLJkqJ5dlrtuusWlZKqtkafBpr7Bmpqk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./aaron-franklin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aaron Franklin Age, Net worth: Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki, Weight">&larr;
