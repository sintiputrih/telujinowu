She was the one from the iconic club scene in Nelly’s </span><i><span>Hot in Here</span></i><span> music video. But sadly, we bear bad news today. Pasha has passed away!</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this “Pasha Bleasdell Bio” to learn more about what happened and her life story.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Pasha Bleasdell Cause Of Death</b></h3><p><span>Pasha Bleasdell passed away from a brain tumor on June 4, 2022.</span></p><p><span>The news about her death was first revealed by the Canadian filmmaker Director X, who’s worked with stars like Drake, Nelly, Rihanna, The Weeknd, and Ariana Grande.</span></p><p><span>“We lost a friend yesterday,” Director X started his IG post featuring Pasha. According to him, his crew first met Pasha doing background work on the set of Donnell Jones’s “Where I Want To Be.” From there, he started to put her in the mix and everything was a “wild ride” from there on.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve put her in a million videos and spent just as much time hanging out,” he added before labeling her as “genuine and cool.” Also, having someone who never “drama to set of life,” Director X considered Pasha one of his top models.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, he lost a genuine co-worker and dear friend Pasha, after almost 2 decades of working together.</span></p><p><span>But he wasn’t the only one who missed her. Under the music director’s post, Busta Rhymes commented, “This is terrible!!! Rest Easy Queen Pasha.” Likewise, Pusha T and Terrence Howard offered their condolences as well and commented with a series of prayer emojis.</span></p><h3><b>Pasha Bleasdell Starred In Nelly’s Hot In Herre Video</b></h3><p><span>Pasha Bleasdell appeared in Nelly’s “Hot In Herre” official music video that was remastered in HD and put on Youtube back in Dec 2009.</span></p><p><span>Though Pasha was featured throughout the video, you might remember her as the girl saying “What?” right after the music is cut off and Nelly goes “Stop placin’, time wastin’ I got a friend with a hole in a basement.”</span></p><h3><b>What Were Pasha Bleasdell Career Highlights?</b></h3><p><span>Besides Nelly’s “Hot In Herre,” Pasha Bleasdell has appeared on 50 Cent’s video for “PIMP” and Sean Paul’s “Gimme the Light.”</span></p><p><span>Also, since Pasha was on good terms with Director X, he often cast her in a number of the clips that he was at the helm of. She was definitely the IT girl for just about every music video in the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>After her death, Diana Reyes, the dance artist of “FLY LADY DI,” took it to her FB to write, “RIP PASHA BLEASDELL…. It was an honor to work with you as much as I did.&nbsp; You were truly a real one.&nbsp; An icon.&nbsp; 🕊 rest in power queen.”</span></p><p><span>And she was just one of many to recall Pasha and the works they shared.</span></p><p><span>Pasha was the original material girl. Every girl wanted to be like her and she was every man’s dream. The jean vest with no shirt/bra, the Kangol with the wash and set, it was Pasha’s style that we’ve stolen.</span></p><p><span>“I always had a big crush on #PashaBleasdell when I was growing up watching Nelly music video Hot In Herre. RIP Pasha Bleasdell,” a used tweeted.</span></p><p><span>While another wrote, “I wanted to look like Pasha Bleasdell when I grew up. May she rest in peace.”</span></p><h3><b>Pasha Bleasdell Husband</b></h3><p><span>Pasha Bleasdell might be in the music industry. But she never let her private life be known to others. Or like Director X said, “She was always genuine and cool. Never brought drama to set of life.”</span></p><p><span>Thus, it’s unclear if Pasha is survived by her husband or a boyfriend.</span></p><p><span>But whoever her loved one may be, we hope they had a chance, to be honest, and show their love before she passed away. For you never know when the last time you speak to someone will be the last time you speak.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Pasha Bleasdell Age At The Time Of Her Death</b></h3><p><span>Pasha was 38 years of age at the time of her death in June 2022.</span></p><p><span>She was born on January 24, 1984, and was of the Aquarius zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Was Pasha Bleasdell On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Pasha didn’t seem to have an Instagram account. Even Director X never tagged her on any of his posts featuring her. This further suggests that Pasha wasn’t much of a social media person.</span></p><p><span>However, we did find her on Pinterest @</span><a href=#><span>pashableasdell</span></a><span>. This could have been her only social media account.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Did Pasha Bleasdell Live At The Time Of Her Death?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>It is believed that Pasha took her last breath in the US surrounded by her family and friends.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>How Tall Was Pasha Bleasdell?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Pasha stood tall at a height under 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm).</span></p><p><span>Her distinct features included dark hair, brown eyes, and a fit body.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>What Do We Know About Pasha Bleasdell Family?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Pasha comes from a Canadian family. Her full name is Pasha de Matas Bleasdell.</span></p><p><span>However, she never revealed her family members.</span></p><p><span>But though out of light, fans from all over the world prayed for her family for strength and offered their condolences.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmqZmjna5ursuemKyclaG5bq7IqGShraOXrq%2BwjKKlrKyRnL%2BiuYyhpq1lmaN6qbHRq5xmmZeafA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./will-elviss-iconic-home-graceland-sold-pay-lisa-maries-debts-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Elvis's iconic home Graceland have to be sold to pay off Lisa Marie's debts?">&larr;
