Along with his skills on the pitch, his unique hairstyle also often gets the limelight.</p><p>The hairstyle of the NFL draft star has added more composition to his physical appearance.</p><p>He is known for his distinctive hairstyle that includes a long braid. The player makes bulky hair on the upper part of the head and ties it at the back.</p><p>His transition from short hairstyles to dreads has left many surprised. Many people are even suspicious of whether the hair is real or fake.</p><p>However, based on various images and videos of him available online, his hair appears natural and not a wig or hair extension.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-2-10.jpg></p><p>Before 2020, he frequently used to have short dreads, as seen in his <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> account.</p><p>However, his signature look now is a long braid, which he flaunts on and off the playground.</p><p>When it comes to color, Robinson has maintained his original color, black. Unlike most players, he does not seem to be interested in changing his hair color.</p><p>The football player is attentive toward his hair which also reflects his sense of caring for his body and discipline as well.</p><h2>Bijan Robinson: Parents</h2><p>Bijan Robinson was born on January 30, 2002, in Tucson, Arizona, United States.</p><p>He was born when his mother, Lamore, was just a college student. The details of his biological father are currently unknown.</p><p>LaMore is licensed to perform aesthetics services, and in addition to that, she works as a makeup artist and distributor for It Works.</p><p>His mother, Lamore, married Lamont Sauls in 2012 when the player was ten years old.</p><p>Bijan chose to stay with his grandparents instead with his mother and stepfather.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-4-11.jpg></p><p>Cleo Robinson, the player’s grandfather, has played a significant role in shaping his professional life.</p><p>Their relationship is beyond the typical grandfather-grandson dynamic, closer to father-son. Bijan even calls him Dad.</p><p>When asked about his grandson, Cleo said, “He’s the person I’ve been admiring all the time”.</p><p>Not only his grandfather but Robinson’s grandmother also loves to watch her husband and grandson playing football.&nbsp;</p><p>The contribution made by his grandparents has helped the player what he has been able to achieve to date.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCuyKOYp2WipK%2BqutKopWagkZ6%2FbrrFpWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./peppermint-frosted-chocolate-brownies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peppermint Frosted Chocolate Brownies  Modern Honey">&larr;
