She has lost a respectable amount of weight, and her turn to a healthier life has made people love her content more.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts-about-eleanor-neale></span>Quick Facts About Eleanor Neale<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=here-are-some-facts-about-eleanor-neale></span>Here Are Some Facts About Eleanor Neale:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>$2.08 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Youtuber</td></tr><tr><td>Ukrainian-British</td></tr><tr><td>January 24, 1999</td></tr><tr><td>England, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Mystery</td></tr><tr><td>215</td></tr><tr><td>2.4M</td></tr><tr><td>2017- Present</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eleanor-neales-weight-loss-journey></span>Eleanor Neale’s Weight Loss Journey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eleanor Neale’s fans were shocked when the YouTuber changed the image she uses on thumbnails to a thinner one.</p><p>The video “THE KILLER OF 100 BOYS” used a strikingly different image of her on the thumbnail than her usual image.</p><p>This image saw her looking much thinner than she usually does, brighter, healthier, and even younger.</p><p>This transformation caused many viewers to go back through her videos. After doing so, they learned that throughout the year 2021, the Youtuber had been gradually looking thinner and thinner on each video.</p><p>Though she briefly returned to her normal thumbnail images after the video mentioned above, she soon started using thumbnails that showcased her new, slimmer self.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eleanor-neales-diet-plan></span>Eleanor Neale’s Diet Plan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>YouTuber Eleanor Neale’s weight loss journey has had many people ask her questions, particularly about the how.</p><p>The Youtuber has not been shy about showing off her slimmer body and talking about how much healthier and brighter she feels.</p><p>However, one thing she hasn’t done is talk about the diet she embarked on to reach the weight she currently is. Still, she has let slip videos of herself cooking in some videos which gives some idea of how she reached her current weight.</p><p>One of the things she seems to be eating a lot is vegetables, particularly mushrooms. Her cooking so much herself must mean that she has cut back on fast food, which surely has positively impacted her weight.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eleanor-neales-workout-plan></span>Eleanor Neale’s Workout Plan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As with her diet, Eleanor Neele has not been open about her workout plan, or if she had any, for her weight loss.</p><p>The reason might be that there wasn’t as much workout as people thought.</p><p>One of the biggest indicators Neale has given behind the reason for her weight loss is that she chose to start a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>A healthier lifestyle, though it does contain exercise, does not have to revolve around the gym or any form of intense exercise.</p><p>Going through her Twitter page shows that the Youtuber has a small disdain for the regular gym-going crowd. She seems more about affirming people who want to live healthier lifestyles.</p><p>To that end, reading between the lines of her weight loss journey shows that Neale started eating healthier and taking care of herself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=backlash-to-eleanor-neales-weight-loss></span>Backlash To Eleanor Neale’s Weight Loss<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite the overwhelming support, some people have not been positively taking Eleanor Neale’s weight loss.</p><p>These detractors have been levying charges of surgery or some form of illegal supplements to be the reason behind Neale’s weight loss.</p><p>Many of these detractors are people who don’t enjoy her content or hate-watch it for a myriad of different reasons, primarily that they don’t like her attitude towards disturbing topics.</p><p>Some even claim that Neale is disrespecting the subjects of her video, though curiously, their retort to her disrespect is by disrespecting her in return.</p><p>Neale, to her credit, has not been engaging with these trolls and seems more content to bask in her now healthier and more wonderful life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-eleanor-neale-dating></span>Who Is Eleanor Neale Dating?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>YouTuber Eleanor Neale does not seem to be dating anyone, nor has she talked about it.</p><p>Now that Eleanor Neale has lost weight, people are asking about more changes in her life, like a new relationship.</p><p>Weight loss has not changed Neale from being the vibrant personality she always was.</p><p>If anything, it seems to have given her more courage to be open and share her personal life in ways than before.</p><p>A look at her Instagram shows just that, as the Youtuber has deleted all of her previous posts and now uploads pictures that showcase her new body.</p><p>However, as private as she has been about her weight loss journey, she is equally as private about other details related to her personal life. One of these details is her relationships.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-eleanor-neale-dating-jack-hodgson></span>Is Eleanor Neale Dating Jack Hodgson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jack Hodgson, or Hodgack as he is known on YouTube, is a Youtuber and friend of Eleanor Neale.</p><p>The two have been friends for a long time, and Neale has posted Hodgson on her social media many times, calling him her best friend.</p><p>She is also very supportive of his Youtube career and often shares new videos he has released on her Twitter account.</p><p>This closeness has led many fans to wonder and ask if the two are dating and in a relationship.</p><p>As of the writing of this article, the most Neale has stated about their relationship is that they are friends, best friends even, and nothing more. Still, this hasn’t stopped people from asking questions.</p><p>Though Eleanor Neale has not stated if she is in a relationship, she can easily be with a man and a woman.</p><p>Neale is bisexual and has been very open about her&nbsp;orientation. She tweets about her orientation, make jokes about it, defends it, but most importantly, treats it like a part of herself and not an accessory.</p><p>Though she hasn’t mentioned dating any woman on social media, that does not detract from her identity.</p><p>However, if she is dating a woman, it could explain why she has not been open about the information. Still, all that one can say about the matter would be conjecture.</p><p>So far, Jack Hodgson is the only person, man or woman, who has been romantically connected to Neale.</p><p>Only time will tell if Neale will reveal the name of her significant other when she eventually gets one.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-there-a-backlash-against-eleanor-neale></span>Why Is There A Backlash Against Eleanor Neale?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As stated above, not everyone has been joining Eleanor Neale with the success of her weight loss journey.</p><p>Many of these disgruntled detractors’ problem with Neale is her conduct when it comes to her videos.</p><p>Though many of them are trolls, an equal amount has a viable reason to dislike the young woman’s content, especially her conduct within the videos.</p><p>Neale tends to sensationalize the content she shares, which is frowned upon when sharing true-crime stories.</p><p>As someone who has been making content like this since her teenage years, Neale’s approach to her content sometimes still echoes that of a teenager, which is one of the backlash levied against her.</p><p>As mentioned above, Neale has not replied or responded to any of these claims, which is great but also bad for her. She escapes criticism, but through that, she also escapes accountability.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-some-of-the-peoples-complaints-against-eleanor-neale></span>What Are Some Of The People’s Complaints Against Eleanor Neale?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The more serious of Eleanor Neale’s detractors have made a list of complaints they have against the Youtuber.</p><p>These complaints revolve around her acting disrespectful to the subject matter. They are as follows:</p><ul><li>Being inappropriately cheerful when introducing the case</li><li>Giggling</li><li>Adding personal opinions about what she would have done in the situation</li><li>Looking at herself through the viewfinder</li><li>Self-promotion while talking about a gruesome case</li><li>Mentioning irrelevant details just for shock factor</li><li>Making inappropriate faces</li><li>Ending videos on cliffhangers</li><li>Telling viewers to stay tuned if they want to hear the gory bits</li><li>Criticizing the sentence an offender received despite her ignorance of the justice system</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-eleanor-neales-net-worth></span>How Much Is Eleanor Neale’s Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eleanor Neale has an estimated net worth of 2.08 Million as of 2022.</p><p>The Youtuber has earned the bulk of her income from her Youtuber channel, which she started on March 28, 2016.</p><p>The first video on her channel is from June 21, 2018. She initially started posting in 2017, but most were makeup-related.</p><p>Neale refashioned her channel to a true-crime-related one in 2018 and has since released 215 videos.</p><p>She still makes makeup-related content and vlogs on her second channel, Eleanor. Neale started this channel on November 21, 2020, and has posted 14 videos on it.</p><p>Lastly, she has a now-defunct channel called Eleanor2, which was once meant to serve as her second channel.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-eleanor-neale-make-money></span>How Does Eleanor Neale Make Money?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>British Youtuber Eleanor Neale makes money primarily off of her Youtube channel but also through other means.</p><p>These other means are sponsorships and merch sales. As a British Youtuber, Neale is part of a group of content creators made by Youtube.</p><p>After taking its cut, the website pays $2-$12 per 1000 monetized views to its creators from the US, UK, and Canada. Also, the longer a viewer stays on the video, the more money the creator makes.</p><p>This system is where Neale thrives because, as her content is true-crime, a genre shrouded in mystery, people are encouraged to watch until the end.</p><p>With more than 2.4 million subscribers on her main channel alone, and with each of her videos reaching a million views minimum, Neale is surely making a good chunk of money from her Youtube channel.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-companies-sponsor-eleanor-neale></span>What Companies Sponsor Eleanor Neale?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eleanor Neale starts each of her videos with a sponsorship announcement.</p><p>This act is also subject to criticism; however, it is a way for her to supplement her income. Here are her usual sponsors:</p><ul><li>NordVPN: A reputable but fairly expensive VPN service that allows people to change the location of their IP address</li><li>Function of Beauty: A cosmetology brand that sells customizable skin and hair products. This brand has recently come under fire due to numerous people complaining about hair loss due to their products.</li><li>Miscellaneous mobile games: Neale promotes a variety of mobile games on her videos, such as Apex Legends, Raid: Shadow Legends, and more.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eleanor-neales-career-earnings></span>Eleanor Neale’s Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Strictly looking at the total views from her main channel, Eleanor Neale has made $4,443,772.</p><p>This amount is calculated by putting her total views, 370,314,350, against the $2-$12 per 1000 monetized views Youtube pays for.</p><p>However, the amount drawn is based on the assumption that Neale earns $12 per 1000 monetized views. Therefore, the amount is pure conjecture and cannot be taken as fact.</p><p>Still, it is a healthy conjecture because of the nature of Neale’s content; one can assume she retains fans.</p><p>Then there is her second channel. She has amassed a total view count of 892,653 on the channel, which means she has earned $10,711 from the channel, bringing her total earnings to $4,454,483.</p><p>It is important to remember that the amount is only based on conjecture derived from her two channels. Neale also has money coming in from her sponsorships and her merchandise.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-brief-summary-of-eleanor-neales-youtube-career></span>A Brief Summary Of Eleanor Neale’s YouTube Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite some controversy, Eleanor Neale has kept pushing through in her Youtube career and has had much success.</p><p>As stated above, almost all her videos average a million views minimum.</p><p>Neale has been one of the biggest names for true crime stories on Youtube for a while now. One of the things that separates her from most other true crime channels is the eclectics of the topics she uses and the speed of her releases.</p><p>As of the writing of this article, Neale has been uploading videos twice a week, which is an astounding speed for the length of videos she makes.</p><p>With a healthy body, healthier attitude, and a new drive behind her videos, Neale seems to be intent on creating videos for as long as she can. Here’s to her continued success.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-eleanor-neales-ethnicity></span>What is Eleanor Neale’s Ethnicity?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>She is of Ukranian descent</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-eleanor-neale-part-of-the-lgbtq></span>Is Eleanor Neale part of the LGBTQ+?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yes, she is bisexual</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-eleanor-neale-used-to-make-makeup-videos></span>Did Eleanor Neale used to make Makeup videos?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yes, she was a makeup channel back in 2017</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2cmq6vu9FmpZ6ZnJp6uLHIoJ%2BtZZykwLR5yaisq6aVrnqltcStZJqmlGLEsL7KqKytZaChrq95kWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./review-stephen-sondheim-90th-birthday-live-stream-concert-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everybody Rise and Discuss Sondheims 90th Birthday Livestream">&larr;
