And as we've all realized and probably even experienced by now, the stress of merely existing in a global pandemic can have long-lasting effects. For many women, that stress can be life-threatening.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Researchers at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, Johns Hopkins, and Cleveland Clinic have found "broken heart syndrome" — a serious heart condition brought on by emotional stress — has surged during the pandemic. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Data's still being gathered</a>, but one study from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Cleveland Clinic</a> found rates have increased from less than 2% to almost 8% during the pandemic. The condition's especially common among women, both in general and during the pandemic, so it's important to understand the risk factors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's what you need to know about "broken heart syndrome" and how it affects women.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>First, what exactly is "broken heart syndrome"?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The name makes it sound kind of trivial, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. "Broken heart syndrome", medically known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a kind of heart attack. Like any other heart attack, it can cause <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>symptoms</a> like shortness of breath, chest pain, and abnormal heart rhythms — but the mechanisms are totally different.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typical heart attacks happen due to a blockage in a heart artery that damages the heart muscle, says cardiologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sharonne N. Hayes</a>, M.D., founder of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Women's Heart Clinic</a> in Rochester, MN. Stress cardiomyopathy, on the other hand, doesn't involve blocked arteries. It can be life-threatening, but because it's easier for the heart to recover, Dr. Hayes says it's more survivable than other types of heart attacks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cases might be surging now, but it's not new. According to Dr. Hayes, the syndrome was first described in 1990. The Japanese researchers that identified it dubbed the syndrome "Takotsubo," because the shape of the left ventricle on an angiogram looks like the same-named ceramic pot used to capture octopuses in the ocean. As the syndrome gained more recognition and it became clearer emotional stress commonly caused it, Dr. Hayes said people started calling it "broken heart syndrome."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What's actually causing stress-induced heart attacks isn't totally clear. Stress affects the body in lots of ways. For example, you might get a tension headache after a long day or, if you're under long-term stress, you're more likely to develop high blood pressure or even problems with your arteries. One unproven hypothesis about stress cardiomyopathy, Dr. Hayes says, is that stress hormones can cause blood vessels in the heart to spasm. "They're not permanently blocked, but they can restrict blood flow and cause the heart muscle to be injured," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Hayes isn't surprised by the pandemic spike, by the way. Heart attacks of all kinds tend to increase as a result of a major stressful event, like say after 9/11 or a natural disaster (though the data doesn't separate stress cardiomyopathy from other heart attacks), she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And a 'broken heart', or emotional stress, isn't the only cause. Physical stress can contribute, too — for example, Dr. Hayes says it's not uncommon for people with other major illnesses to have this kind of heart attack. So while pandemic stress is almost certainly contributing to the numbers, the surge could also be connected to Covid-19 infection itself, or due to people delaying their care for other medical issues during the pandemic, she explains.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The problem with calling it "broken heart syndrome" — and the risk factors you need to know about.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A stress-induced heart attack can happen to anyone, but according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>American College of Cardiology</a>, postmenopausal women make up 90% of stress cardiomyopathy cases. "We don't want to call out women, but if a woman of that age comes in with those symptoms, a clinician's ears should perk up," Dr. Hayes says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, she agrees calling a potentially deadly condition "broken heart syndrome" trivializes the risk (which is why she uses the medical term and usually refers to the nickname in quotes). The term also plays on healthcare inequities that women, especially women of color, face every day. Doctors are more likely to dismiss women's chest pain or shortness of breath as psychosomatic, and anxiety can cause those things. Cardiomyopathy, on the other hand, is an actual medical emergency caused by stress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Dr. Hayes emphasizes it's not that women are "just more emotional." "Physiologically, a woman's response to stress is different than a man's," she says. For example, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>research</a> shows that under mental stress, men and women can experience totally different changes in blood pressure and blood flow, which might account for the disproportionate rates of stress cardiomyopathy among women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some women with stress cardiomyopathy also have other risk factors for heart attack, like high blood pressure, but according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>American Heart Association</a>, traditional heart attack risk factors don't apply. So while it's easier said than done when you're living through a pandemic and systemic gender inequity, Dr. Hayes says one of the most important ways to prevent it is to manage your stress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For me to suggest a woman's untreated anxiety or depression needs to be managed could sound like I think it's all in their head," says Dr. Hayes. "How I couch it is, there's a very strong mind-heart connection. If we don't deal with our stress and worry, we can't heal our hearts."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWmrcutn2aemam7pr%2FSaJmrp5uau260xJqprWWjrrulvs6mnA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./city-in-westchester-to-celebrate-annual-restaurant-week-these-eateries-participating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="City In Westchester To Celebrate Annual Restaurant Week: These Eateries Participating">&larr;
