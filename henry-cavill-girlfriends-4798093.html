It isn’t hard to imagine a legion of fans swooning over the 39-year-old heartthrob, who went from being a co-star in Showtime’s The Tudors to headlining as comic book icon Superman in 2013’s Man of Steel.&nbsp; Of course, during his rise to fame, Henry called a bevy of beauties his girlfriend, from a championship horse rider to a college student!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Henry-Cavill-Natalie-Viscuso-ss-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The British actor is currently dating, <strong>Natalie Viscuso </strong>(read about her further below).&nbsp;After over a year of dating, Henry and his blonde bombshell made their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>red carpet debut</a> on Oct. 27, 2022. The two attended the premiere of the Netflix movie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Enola Holmes 2</a>&nbsp;and proved their love is one for keeps. At the lavish event, Natalie wore a stunning cream-colored gown with a belt that hugged her waist. Henry opted for a classic grey pinstripe suit and crimson-colored tie that night. Keep reading to find out more about Natalie and the women who stole the matinee idol’s heart, below!</p><h2>Ellen Whitaker</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Born March 5, 1986 <strong>Ellen Whitaker</strong> is a British champion horse jumper who has competed in the equestrian sport since she was a child. In a May 2011 interview with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Belfast Telegraph</a>, Ellen revealed Henry had popped the question. “I couldn’t believe it when he asked me to marry him,” she said. “I thought we were there to celebrate his birthday. It was such a surprise and I am so happy.” Sadly, they broke it off within a year.</p><h2>Gina Carano</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/henry-cavill-gina-carano-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Henry first began dating<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>&nbsp;Gina Carano</strong></a> in 2012 after his failed engagement with Ellen. During their on-again/off-again romance, the stuntwoman/actress even adopted a puppty with the ‘The Witcher’ star. The couple officially split in 2014. Gina has now become best known for<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> being fired from The Mandalorian </a>after a series of offensive tweets. The scandal even had Henry trending at the time for his past romance with the embattled star.</p><h2>Kaley Cuoco</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Henry and Big Bang star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kaley Cuoco</strong></a> shocked fans when it was reported that they were an item back in 2013. Even more shocking was the fact that the romance only lasted 10 days! Although the relationship was brief, it was certainly a high-profile one for the young actress, causing her to gain new fans on social media. “I had no-one following me until I met Superman,” the actress hilariously revealed in an interview, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a>. “I’ve been in this business for 20 years, and my whole life I could go anywhere, do anything. There had not been one paparazzi photo of me until like several months ago. The recognition was crazy.”</p><h2>Tara King</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/henry-cavill-tara-king-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Henry undoubtedly raised an eyebrow or two when it was revealed he was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dating a college student</a> in 2015. <strong>Tara King</strong> was only 19 at the time when she first met Henry at the London nightclub Mahiki. Despite their 13-year age gap, Henry brought along his girlfriend to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair’s&nbsp;Oscars party</a> in Feb. 2016. Tara was also his date to the London premiere of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in March 2016. By May of that year, the romance was off.</p><h2>Natalie Viscuso</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Natalie Viscuso</strong></a> was the Vice President of Television and Digital Studios at Legendary Entertainment, a production company that worked on Man of Steel. These days she is the impressive VP of TV at Vertigo Entertainment, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Just Jared</a>. Henry and Natalie first went public on April 10, 2021, when Henry shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet photo</a> of the pair on Instagram. “This is me looking quietly confident shortly before my beautiful and brilliant love Natalie, destroys me at chess,” he raved. Natalie, in turn, shared a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tribute</a> to Henry on his 38th birthday on May 5th, 2021. “Happiest of birthdays to my birthday boy,” she wrote. While they are rarely photographed together in public, eagle-eyed fans assume the couple are still an item as he posted about her dog on Instagram in April 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>On May 12, 2022, Natalie revealed her new job at Vertigo Entertainment, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>via Instagram</a>. “Genre storytelling has been the beating heart of who I am ever since I was a child. I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to translate that passion into a career, and to have done so with some of the best in the business. The past few years at Legendary were an unparalleled adventure, and the decision to leave was one of the hardest yet. That said, this next chapter is one I’ve dreamt about for ages and could not be more excited for. I can’t wait to show you what we’re building at Vertigo. Stay tuned…!”, she captioned the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8eepauxXZiut7XLpWSgoaKhs7O1xKebrGVkbIZ5fJhsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jayne-atkinson-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jayne Atkinson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
