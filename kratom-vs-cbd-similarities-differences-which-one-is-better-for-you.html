Local and state laws for use and possession of THC vary by jurisdiction and should be reviewed before purchase.</p><p>Both kratom and CBD are being scooped up by millions of people who want a natural solution for pain, anxiety and more.</p><p>And for good reason: Both are considered bonafide plant medicines with legitimate scientific research to back their healthy qualities.</p><p>Not to mention, the internet and social media networks are brimming with happy users whose anecdotal testimony on the whole is pretty promising.</p><p>Kratom and CBD are now both popular supplements that are said to help with a variety of health issues, including pain, insomnia and stress. They both come from plants, and they both come with a boatload of social proof. But the big question is: Which one should you take?</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about kratom vs CBD. You’ll see in our explanation that they share a lot in common, but there’s also some marked differentiators that can make one more appealing than the other, depending on the person.</p><p>We also took the liberty of choosing the top 5 kratom & CBD products this year based on quality, effectiveness, and user experience. Check them out below to get your plant-based wellness on:</p><h2>2023 Best Kratom and CBD Products</h2><li><strong>Best Energy Boosting Kratom: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">K-Tropix 2K Energy Capsules</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best CBD for Calm: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jupiter Oasis Organic CBD Calm Drops</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best Kratom for Sleep: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Top Extracts Kali Red Horn Kratom Powder</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best Kratom for Dealing with Chronic Pain: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kingdom Kratom Boost White Blend Capsules</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best CBD Roll-On for Pain Relief: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Absolute Nature CBD Roll-On Cooling Effect</a></strong></li><h2>What Is CBD?</h2><p>CBD, or cannabidiol, is one of many phytochemicals known as cannabinoids that are naturally present in the hemp plant. Unlike THC, another popular cannabinoid, CBD will not get you high and has been declared safe by the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">World Health Organization</a>.</p><p>In order to make a CBD product or supplement, the CBD must be extracted from the raw cannabis plant material. This can be done in a variety of ways, including oil extraction and using supercritical CO2.</p><h3>How CBD Works</h3><p>At the biological level, CBD works by acting upon what’s called the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. All mammals have an endocannabinoid system, which is really a network of cannabinoid receptors that reside in the body. This network is responsible for regulating some of the body’s most major processes, like homeostasis.</p><p>CBD works by binding with the body’s endocannabinoid receptors, a union that activates the endocannabinoid network to have positive effects on mind and body.</p><h3>Uses for CBD</h3><p>Most commonly, people seek out CBD for help with pain, anxiety, and sleep. Because CBD is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">natural anti-inflammatory</a>, there are many applications for use that wellness junkies all over the world swear by. Here are the most common uses for CBD:</p><ul><li>Pain relief</li><li>Stress & anxiety</li><li>Sleep</li><li>Seizures</li><li>Mood</li><li>Acne and skin health</li><li>Overall wellbeing</li><li>Pet health & wellness</li></ul><h3>Side Effects of CBD</h3><p>CBD is known to present minimal side effects, even at high doses, which are not offered by legitimate CBD companies. However, here is the current, official list of CBD side effects provided by the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">US Food & Drug Administration</a>: changes in alertness or drowsiness, gastrointestinal distress, and changes in mood (aka irritability and agitation).</p><h2>What Is Kratom?</h2><p>Kratom, aka Mitragyna speciosa, is a plant that is indigenous to Southeast Asia, specifically Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Its leaves contain an alkaloid called mitragynine and have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a long history of therapeutic use</a> in the area. People living in the region have ground up kratom leaves into tea for some hundreds of years to treat fatigue while working in the elements all day. Kratom has also traditionally been used to treat pain and diarrhea.</p><p>Kratom comes in various strains, the most popular of which are red, white, green, and yellow kratom. Each genetic variety comes with a slightly different effect. For example, white kratom is known for its energy-enhancing properties, while red kratom usually provides a more calming, restful experience.</p><h3>How Kratom Works</h3><p>Kratom is considered by many to be a natural opioid, in that at a molecular level, its components bind to opioid receptors — which is why it can sometimes be used to help those going through opioid withdrawal. In lower doses, kratom is known for its energizing effects, while higher doses are more linked to relieving pain and promoting relaxation.</p><p>Unlike prescription opioids, kratom only inactivates specific signals between receptors, so it doesn’t come with the side effects typically found from prescription opioid use. However, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">FDA still has not approved kratom for use</a> and says it is still evaluating available information about safe use of kratom.</p><p>Uses for Kratom</p><p>Kratom’s history as a stimulant and natural remedy for various other ailments in Southeast Asia has made it a popular choice in the modern world. Most commonly, people use kratom for the following issues:</p><ul><li>Relieving pain</li><li>Energy</li><li>Stress & anxiety</li><li>Sleep</li><li>Mood</li></ul><h3>Side Effects of Kratom</h3><p>Kratom users who stay at lower doses tend to report less experiences of side effects. Here is the official list of kratom side effects from the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DEA</a>: nausea, sweating, dry mouth, itching, constipation, increased urination, vomiting, drowsiness, and appetite loss. There have also been user reports of weight loss, insomnia, seizures, and hallucinations at high doses.</p><h2>Similarities Between Kratom and CBD</h2><h3>They both come from plants.</h3><p>Kratom is sourced from plants cultivated in Southeast Asia, while CBD comes from hemp. While you can easily get CBD made from US-grown hemp, kratom is not currently commercially cultivated in the US and Canada. Therefore, all kratom plants and plant material must be imported from Southeast Asia.</p><h3>They both are documented to relieve pain.</h3><p>Although there are less scientific studies on kratom as a treatment for pain versus CBD, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">current research is promising</a>. At this point, most of the documentation of kratom as a pain reliever is anecdotal. On the flip side, CBD has been specifically studied for its benefits as a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">natural anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving substance</a>.</p><h3>They both are taken for calming effect.</h3><p>CBD has been researched to have a positive effect on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">anxiety symptoms</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sleep</a>. Plus, there are neverending testimonials from CBD users that back this up. Kratom also has documented use for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">anxiety and even depression</a>, but to this point, most of that research is based on surveys and self-reporting. Note, however, that kratom can cause psychoactive effects, depending on which strain you’re taking.</p><h3>They are both largely unregulated supplements.</h3><p>Both CBD and kratom are largely unregulated among governing bodies in the US, though CBD can only be sold legally with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">0.3%-or-lower THC by dry weight</a>. This means that finding trustworthy growers and manufacturers is critical to having a good experience. With both CBD and kratom, vendors should be transparent by disclosing their geographic sourcing and their processing. They should also conduct third-party tests for potency and contaminants, and these results should be made available to consumers before purchase.</p><h2>Kratom vs CBD: Which One To Use</h2><p>A lot of this comes down to personal tastes (both literal and figurative). Since we already talked about the similarities between CBD and kratom, let’s touch on a few things that make them different. Here’s some guidance:</p><p><strong>If you want relief from pain:</strong> Both CBD and kratom may help you get some natural relief. However, both the scientific and anecdotal evidence is more abundant to support CBD’s natural pain-relieving properties compared to kratom.</p><p><strong>If you want a palpable energy boost:</strong> This is definitely the kratom realm. If you want all-day energy that you can feel, kratom is the way to go, as its energizing effects are more well-documented than CBD. While most people take CBD to relax, people like to take kratom for natural energy.</p><p><strong>If you’re worried about drug testing:</strong> For those who need to pass a drug test, kratom may be the better choice, as it most likely will not be tested. However, if your heart is set on CBD, never fear. Simply opt for a 0% THC option if you need to be drug tested for work. This includes products made from broad spectrum CBD or CBD isolate.</p><p><strong>How do you like your plant medicine?</strong> To take kratom, you’ll need to either take capsules, make tea with kratom leaves, or use kratom powder to make something you can eat or drink. CBD comes in way more varieties; we’re talking capsules, edibles, tinctures, creams, vapes, and more. It’s all about how you want to take your natural plant meds.</p><h2>Best CBD and Kratom Products in 2023</h2><h3>1.

Modern life has brought on a plethora of daily stress for most of us, and we think that these organic CBD drops from Jupiter are the antidote.</p><p>What makes these CBD drops so effective for relaxation? We think it’s the combination of stellar ingredients.</p><p>First up, Jupiter uses full spectrum CBD oil which contains multiple synergistic cannabinoids and terpenes. In layman’s terms, it’s really potent and as close to the raw plant as you can get.</p><p>Next, Jupiter includes more hempy goodness by infusing additional terpenes into the mix.

Different strains have different effects, and sometimes these effects can be super-subtle.</p><p>Red kratom strains are known to be relaxing, pain-relieving, and even sleep-inducing. But this variety from Top Extracts is a different kind of red. It’s good for anytime!</p><p>While lots of users take this ‘Kali Red’ kratom at night for relief from pain and to promote sleep, there isn’t a strong sedation like most red strains. Instead, it’s more like a relaxed vibe with a little energy and focus. You can really take it at any time of day.</p><p>As with most kratom, taking less Kali Red will give you a more energetic experience, while higher amounts will be more relaxing.</p><p>Kali Red comes from the gorgeous kratom tree that has prominent red veins. It’s different from most of its red kratom counterparts, in that many describe its feeling as energizing rather than calming. It’s great for overall wellness.</p><p>If you’re new to kratom or you just want to be healthier, Kali Red is a great choice. You can use Top Extracts kratom powder in smoothies or blended in water.

White kratom is known for its energizing properties as well as aiding discomfort from aches and pains.</p><p>We also love that Kingdom Kratom is obsessed with testing.
