The most nominated actor in the history of the Oscars, his 12 nominations have netted him three of the coveted golden statuettes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That’s not the only area where Nicholson takes the lead, however. The star is said to have slept with over 1000 women during his lifetime. In fact, when once asked if this could possibly be a true number, he replied, “I don’t count”. His longest relationship was with Anjelica Huston, but even <a href=#>during their 17 years together, Jack cheated many times</a>.</p><h2 id=this-is-how-many-children-jack-nicholson-has>This Is How Many Children Jack Nicholson Has</h2><p>Irrespective of how many liaisons the Hollywood star has had, he’s fathered five children with four different women, all but one of them born out of wedlock. And although they’re nowhere near earning the $400 Million their dad has amassed, they’ve had varying successes both in front of and behind the cameras, and in the other careers they’ve followed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Jack Nicholson’s 5 Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-nicholson-is-worth-almost-5-million>Jennifer Nicholson Is Worth Almost $5 Million</h2><p>Jennifer Nicholson is the only one of Jack’s children born in wedlock. She made her debut into the world on 6 September 1963, the first child of her famous father and his wife, fellow actor Sandra Knight.</p><p>Her parents split when she was just six, and Jennifer stayed with her mom in Hawaii. On the occasions she saw her dad, she was taken to wild parties, and even saw forays into the Playboy Mansion. Despite all that, Jennifer survived.</p><p>Her working life has included a number of acting roles, with appearances in Hoffa, Johnny Christ, Wolf and Citizens, amongst others.</p><p>Jennifer stepped away from the lights to pursue a career in fashion and interior design, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">owns the popular clothing boutique, Pearl</a> in Santa Monica. Over the years, her net worth has reportedly been growing, and today she is worth almost $5 Million.</p><h2 id=jack-nicholson-39-s-son-caleb-is-not-a-top-earner>Jack Nicholson's Son Caleb Is Not A Top Earner</h2><p>Caleb James Goddard, born 26 September 1970, was not initially acknowledged by Nicholson as his child, and so he took the name of his stepfather, actor Mark Goddard. In 1996 the Batman star finally relented.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Possibly those early years affected Goddard, who has followed his parents into the entertainment world. Caleb is nowhere near as prolific as his father when it comes to film work. The son of the Batman star and actress Susan Anspach appeared in The Slap Maxwell Story in 1998.He’s also worked on the technical side of the industry. Despite various media searches, Goddard's net worth remains undisclosed.</p><h2 id=honey-holman-is-worth-1-million>Honey Holman Is Worth $1 Million</h2><p>Born on New Year’s Day, 1981 after an affair between the Danish model Winnie Holman and Nicholson, Honey also spent some time in front of the cameras, and enjoyed great popularity in the 2010 TV drama Empire North.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also presented a news program, Go in her home country of Denmark. After bowing out of the limelight, she is married, with three children and lives in the Irish town of Trim, where she owns and runs a pub with her husband, Peter Duffy.</p><p>In addition, she is the founder of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CULT: ZERO, an organic zero waste and plastic free store</a>. She keeps her affairs private, so it’s difficult to accurately assess her financial worth, which is rumored to be around $1 Million.</p><h2 id=lorraine-nicholson-is-worth-14-million>Lorraine Nicholson Is Worth $14 Million</h2><p>Making her entry into the world in 1990, Lorraine Nicholson is the older of two children born to Nicholson and Rebecca Broussard.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Jack Nicholson's Youngest Daughter Looks Like Now</a></span></p><p>Like her siblings, Lorraine also graced the silver screen, making her first appearance at the age of just 13 alongside her dad in Something's Gotta Give in 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack's youngest daughter went on to be named as Miss Golden Globe four years later for that role and her performances in Click and Princess Diaries 2. Her last acting performances were in 2016, in Room 105 and Anonymous.</p><p>Today she’s making a name for herself behind the cameras, as a screenwriter and director. Worth $14 Million, it seems her famous father’s mentorship is helping her to build her own fortune.</p><h2 id=ray-broussard-nicholson-has-raked-in-1-4-million>Ray Broussard Nicholson Has Raked In $1.4 Million</h2><p>The baby of the brood is Ray Broussard Nicholson, born in 1992. Also an actor, he kicked off his career in The Benchwarmers (2006), before moving on to performances in films like The Outsider (2018) and Promising Young Woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ray started making huge waves in the 2021 Amazon Prime Video series Panic, which was unfortunately cut after 10 episodes. That hasn’t deterred him, however. In the same year, he went on to work alongside the great Anthony Hopkins in the 2021 short film Where Are You, and received great reviews.</p><p>The 30-year-old has a net worth of $1.4Million. Not bad for someone who was almost named “Landslide” by his famous father.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jack Nicholson Is 83: Here's Everything He's Achieved So Far</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmpubYruqr8eoo6ynnmKwqbXLnamepl2jsrV51qipraBf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tara-wallace-new-boyfriend-peter-gunz-upset-romance-lhh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Gunz Furious Over Romance?
