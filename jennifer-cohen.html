Folt named Jennifer Cohen as the school’s new athletic director. Cohen will start on Tuesday in the famed athletics program at the institution after competing in college sports for more than three decades.</p><p>At USC, Cohen will hold the Charles Gryphon Cale Director of Athletics Chair after spending the last seven years as athletic director at the University of Washington. She has been employed by Washington for 25 years and has previously held a number of jobs in the management of collegiate athletics at Texas Tech University, Pacific Lutheran University, and the University of Puget Sound. She will be the eighth director of athletics at USC and the first woman to occupy the position.</p><p>As Folt said, “We set a high bar when we were articulating the prerequisites for our future director of athletics. We had a long list of exceptional people who wanted to go to USC and succeed on the biggest stage. Because of her history, dedication to students’ success, and well-known capacity for team building, Jen Cohen definitely stood out from the crowd. She is a fierce rival who, like all Trojans, is motivated to win morally. I have no doubt that she will establish an environment where honesty, collaboration, and success are valued.</p><p>Southern Californian Cohen expressed her delight at joining the Trojan Family at such a crucial time. Cohen said he has long valued the USC community’s commitment to Fight On with honor and unflinching enthusiasm in the pursuit of success on and off the field. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to return to Southern California as USC’s director of athletics and formally join the Trojan Family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Under_the_current_USC_sports_director_there_is_a_strong_emphasis_on_student_academic_and_athletic_achievement></span><strong>Under the current USC sports director, there is a strong emphasis on student academic and athletic achievement.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Folt claimed to have consulted with numerous student-athletes, coaches, staff members, and other stakeholders during the hiring process. Folt argued that Cohen fulfills all requirements for the position and lays a strong emphasis on his pupils’ success in both their academic and athletic endeavors. Parker Executive Search provided assistance to the institution at every stage of the process.</p><p>Reimagining sports is one of Folt’s “moonshots” for the university. Her objective is to establish the best athletics program in the nation with top-notch leadership and state-of-the-art facilities. She recently revealed the university’s strategic strategy for all 21 sports programs as part of a thorough round of reforms.</p><p>These enhancements include major additions to Dedeaux Field and the Galen Centre arena for USC baseball, as well as the construction of Rawlinson Stadium, the new home of the women’s lacrosse and soccer teams at USC. The John McKay Centre will be expanded, the student-athlete dining hall will be upgraded, and the golf practice facility will also receive an upgrade.</p><p>The groundbreaking of Rawlinson Stadium, which will house the Women of Troy when it is complete in 2025, comes at a pivotal time for Title IX, the landmark statute that has fueled women’s athletic success for the past 50 years.</p><p>The USC Athletics Department is positioned for long-term success through Title IX compliance, world-class facilities, and innovative space utilization thanks to this strategic vision and other elements of Folt’s athletics moonshot. The institution is also developing a number of venues for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.</p><p>Prior to USC’s anticipated entrance to the Big Ten, a league that prioritizes both academic and athletic excellence, these adjustments are made. USC Athletics broke the previous departmental record by achieving a multiyear 2023 NCAA Academic Progress Rate of 990. In 2022, the Graduation Success Rate of USC student-athletes climbed for the ninth year in a row, reaching an all-time high of 93%.</p><p>27 players make up the First Team. During the academic year 2022-2023, USC student-athletes earned All-American honors and 16 spots on the All-Pac-12 First Team; 11 teams finished in the top 25; 16 teams made the postseason; and USC won the Crosstown Cup. Additionally, under coach Lincoln Riley, USC football was undefeated at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the 2022 campaign, and Caleb Williams won the Heisman Trophy, making him the sixth official Heisman Trophy winner for the institution in collegiate football history. The women’s beach volleyball team from USC also won its third straight NCAA championship.</p><p>This is a positive sign for the future because six USC teams, including men’s basketball, football, tennis, and volleyball as well as women’s basketball and golf, recruited and signed the best athlete in their respective 2023 classes.</p><p>USC is a dominant force in college athletics on a national scale. According to Cohen, “I look forward to honoring the Trojan heritage while working alongside the incredible USC Athletics team as we embrace both the opportunities and challenges of this complex moment.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jennifer_Cohen_USC_Husband_Books_Net_Worth_Washington></span><strong>Jennifer Cohen USC, Husband, Books, Net Worth, Washington</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The University of Southern California (USC) is now led by Jennifer Cohen as its athletic director. She is the first female employee of USC to occupy this post. From 2016 to 2023, Cohen served as the University of Washington’s (UW) athletic director.</p><p>Cohen is an Arcadia, California native. In 1991, she earned a business administration degree from San Diego State University. She is also a Pacific Lutheran University graduate with a master’s in sports administration.</p><p>As a UW intern in 1993, Cohen got her start in collegiate athletics. Over the next 23 years, she held a number of positions at UW, including chief operating officer and associate athletic director for development.</p><p>Cohen was appointed the UW athletic director in 2016. She was in charge of managing a department with 22 varsity sports and a more than $100 million budget. In her time at Washington, Cohen guided the team to numerous triumphs, including the Pac-12 football championship in 2016.</p><p>Cohen was appointed the USC athletic director in 2023. As the Trojans prepare to join the Big Ten Conference in 2024, she will have to guide them through a period of change.</p><p>Cohen is wed to attorney Michael Cohen. They have two youngsters.</p><p>Cohen has not written any books.</p><p>Cohen’s net worth is not publicly known.</p><p><strong>Here are some additional details about Jennifer Cohen:</strong></p><ul><li>She is a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee.</li><li>She is a board member of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA).</li><li>She is a graduate of the Executive Program for Sports Executives at Harvard Business School.</li></ul><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Laura Coombs Partner, Wikipedia, Wiki, Stats, Partner, Husband, Instagram</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Allen Iverson And Da Brat Relationship</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Victor Sykes Wiki, Wikipedia, Lia, Boy Erased Real Story, Conversion Therapy</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtoopWju6qyxKtknKeYmrtw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./melody-thornton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Melody Thornton Family Tree &amp;amp; History, Ancestry &amp;amp; Genealogy">&larr;
