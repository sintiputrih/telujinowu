He was born on February 23, 1996, and grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, where he attended Central High School as a freshman in 2010-11.</strong></p><p>However, he transferred to Montverde Academy in Montverde, Florida for his sophomore season, where he helped the school win back-to-back High School National Tournament championships alongside Ben Simmons.</p><p>In 2014, Russell was selected as a McDonald’s All-American and played in the McDonald’s All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic. He committed to Ohio State on June 7, 2013, choosing the Buckeyes over Louisville, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Russell was a five-star recruit and played one season of college basketball for the Ohio State Buckeyes.</p><p>During his freshman year, Russell set several records and received numerous awards. He recorded a triple-double with 23 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 79-60 win over Rutgers, becoming the first Ohio State freshman to achieve this feat. He also earned the Oscar Robertson Trophy, Wayman Tisdale Award, and Jerry West Award, and was named a consensus first-team All-American, as well as first-team All-Big Ten and Big Ten Freshman of the Year. In 35 games for Ohio State in 2014-15, Russell averaged 19.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 1.6 steals in 33.9 minutes per game.</p><p>On April 22, 2015, Russell declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility.

During his lone season on Golden State, Russell averaged a career-high 23.6 points per game.

On February 11, Russell made his Lakers return, putting up 15 points, five rebounds, and six assists in a 109-103 win over the Golden State Warriors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>D’Angelo Russell Net Worth: How Much Is D’Angelo Russell Worth?</h2><p>He has a net worth of $27 million, and aside from gaining money from basketball, D’Angelo Russell has endorsement deals with companies such as Nike and Panini America, and has been featured in advertising campaigns for brands such as Foot Locker and Mountain Dew.</p><p>In addition, D’Angelo Russell has invested in the tech industry, including a stake in the startup company Call of Duty Endowment, which aims to help veterans find employment.</p><p>He has also started his own company, called “The Dynasty Initiative,” which provides resources and support for athletes to build their personal brands and businesses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2Yp5%2BVobxuvtSsqp6knGK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ocotillo-elementary-school.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ocotillo Elementary School - Palmdale">&larr;
