As a part of that piece, the publication revealed that Ledger's only child, his daughter Matilda Ledger, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just over two years old at the time of her father's passing</a>.</p><p>Ideally, anyone who has a child should have an up-to-date will to take care of them if anything happens.

However, Forbes published an article using Ledger's estate as an example of a kind of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mistake that everyone should avoid at all costs</a>.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Heath Ledger left behind an estate that was worth a lot of money. The website reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the estate Ledger left behind would be worth $16 million</a> as of January 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reason why <strong>Ledger's will is a cautionary tale</strong> is that the actor never updated his estate plans after his daughter was born. That meant that none of the actor's fortune was left to his daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/heath-ledger-at-candy-screening-at-tribeca-grand-hotel.jpg><p>When Ledger passed away, his will stipulated that <strong>his entire fortune would be left to the actor's parents and three sisters</strong>.
