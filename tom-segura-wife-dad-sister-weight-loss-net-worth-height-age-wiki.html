It was not long after their wedding in 2011 that they started their podcast together.&nbsp;It is the very beautiful woman who ensured the production of the bi-weekly podcast.</span></p><p><span>Apart from being a comedian like her husband, Christina is also an animation writer and she has done voice acting for some.&nbsp;It was from there that she decided to focus mainly on the comedy scene.&nbsp;Ten years later, the royal comedians are married, have a child and are expecting the second child who Christina calls ‘thug 2’.&nbsp;Their first child was born in 2016 and she is expected to give birth to the second towards the end of 2018.</span></p><p><span>Christina Pazsitzky and Segura now reside in Los Angeles, where they also work.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>The comedian has a net worth of $3 million.&nbsp;His wife, on the other hand, has an estimated net worth of $2 million.&nbsp;With more projects on the way at the moment, it’s expected that the super comedy duo will see their value rise even faster.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and body weight (weight loss)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Now a dad, the comedian joked that he needs to try his hand and lose weight because he doesn’t want his kids to be called to school because their dad is fat.&nbsp;The irony is that, as has been pointed out, his weight was one of the things that saved his life when he was a teenager, when he overdosed.</span></p><p><span>Looking at the man’s body measurement, he is slightly above average in weight and height.&nbsp;While his height is 6ft 1in (1.85m), his weight is unknown, although he revealed that he and another comic star who is also overweight made fans bulk up to shaming them in a weight loss contest.&nbsp;Thanks to this, he lost up to 50 pounds.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGisn6J6tLHGrqmaZaees6Z5w5qbZquZqMGmvoywnKKfmKl6rbvSrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkoZ2ZnLW1ecCgnGavmaC2cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-janet-leigh-holdens-net-worth-in-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Janet Leigh Holdens net worth in 2023?">&larr;
