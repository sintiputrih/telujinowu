Roppo co-starred in the series with his younger sister, Corinna Roppo.</p><p>Following his involvement on the Netflix dating program, the affable model has received a lot of attention. As a result, viewers may be left wondering how old Joey Roppo is. As of 2022, the TV celebrity is 28 years old. Despite the fact that Joey is a protective elder brother, they have been close friends and share everything.</p><h2>Joey Roppo Wiki: The Reality Star Was A Division II Basketball Player</h2><p>Joey Roppo was born in Washington in 1994 and resided in Seattle before going to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the entertainment and influencer industries. There is no Wikipedia entry for the actor model. However, considering his ambitions to enter the modeling and acting industries, this is likely to change shortly. He has received offers from a variety of agencies. The Netflix star had just a few thousand followers before the episode aired, but that figure has already risen to 50k on both Instagram and TikTok. The dating show candidate was an avid basketball and football player in high school. He played basketball for the Central Washington University Wildcats as a Division II player.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Joey-Roppo-1.jpg alt="Joey Roppo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Aside from athletics, he was intellectually gifted and was nominated for the ITAM Boeing Scholarship by one of his teachers. The former basketball player has a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Administrative Management.&nbsp;His alma university, Central Washington University, also awarded him a Master’s degree in Athletic Administration. While earning his master’s degree, he worked as an assistant to the men’s basketball coach.</p><p>The former college basketball player quit the sport to seek a professional marketing job with Elan Marketing Inc. He then spent two years as a logistics specialist at Black Rhino Marketing. Prior to the reality program, the actor worked as a customs broker for Expeditors, a logistics company.</p><h2>Joey Roppo’s Partner: His Relationship With Co-Star Julia Perfetto</h2><p>The 28-year-old has not shared much about his prior partnerships. The Roppo brothers did, however, acknowledge to having catastrophic love lives. In the episode, Joey became close to fellow cast member Julia Perfetto. The pair looked to be in good health. Julia, on the other hand, picked another candidate, William, for Prom Night, crushing Joey’s heart. Joey and Julia afterward sought to mend their friendship. However, nothing came of it; instead, they opted to be friends. Roppo stood alone in front of the show’s presenter, Melinda Berry, at the season finale since he couldn’t find love in the villa.</p><p>The Roppo siblings, on the other hand, recently hung out with the Perfetto siblings in Los Angeles. They collaborated on TikToks and were featured on Julia’s YouTube channel. The on-again, off-again couple shared an Instagram photo and a few TikTok vids. They also work out together on occasion.&nbsp;Since the show’s debut, fans have been shipping Roppo and Julia. However, no suggestions or confirmations have been provided by them.</p><h2>Reality TV Star on Netflix Joey Roppo Hails from Monroe, Washington</h2><p><strong>Joey Roppo</strong> and his younger sister, Corinna Marie Roppo, were born in Monroe, Snohomish County, to Joe Roppo and Carley Roppo.&nbsp;The Ropes were raised in a Christian home.&nbsp;Carkey Roppo, his mother, has a Facebook account but is seldom active on it. The Roppo siblings, on the other hand, have not revealed anything about their parents.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Joey-Roppo-2.jpg alt="Joey Roppo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Joe, the reality star’s father, and Joey have played basketball every weekend since Joey was a child. Later, when he got older, the father-son team began playing tennis together.&nbsp;Joey also has a sister, Mary Lynn Roppo, who works as a Starbucks barista and went to the same high school as her brother. The “Dated & Related” siblings were originally hesitant and embarrassed about dating and flirting in front of their siblings. However, as the season progressed, their uneasiness faded.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsButs6esGaqn6W9sHnFq6amZZSWwaawjJqlnWWimrmiwMSdZLChm556orrDZp2apZmhxnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-is-kiyoshi-kuromiya-phone-in-google-doodle-tributed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Is Kiyoshi Kuromiya Phone In Google Doodle Tributed?
