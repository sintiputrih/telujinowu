Staircase cost = $1.30 * steps Staircase cost = $1.30 * 14 Staircase cost = $18.20 Subtract this from the cost of the total cleaning bill of $253.95. We do this to isolate the cost of the carpet. Carpet cost = $253.95 - $18.20 Carpet cost = $235.75 Now, the remaining carpet cost can be written as: 75 + $0.25(s - 180) = $235.75 &lt;-- were s is the total square foot of carpet cleaned Multiply through and simplify: 75 + 0.25s - 45 = $235.75 Combine like terms: 0.25s + 30 = 235.75 [URL='https://www.mathcelebrity.com/1unk.php?num=0.25s%2B30%3D235.75&pl=Solve']Type this equation into our search engine[/URL] to solve for s, and we get: s = [B]823[/B]<br></p><a href=# title="Click to jump to A cash register contains $5 bills and $20 bills with a total value of $180 .

If two people are turned into zombies today, how long will it take for the population of about 600,000 to turn into zombies? Let d = every 2 days. We set up the exponential equation 2 * 2^d = 600,000 Divide each side by 2: 2^d = 300000 To solve this equation for d, we [URL='https://www.mathcelebrity.com/natlog.php?num=2%5Ed%3D300000&pl=Calculate']type it in our math engine[/URL] and we get d = 18.19 (2 day periods) 18.19 * days per period = 36.38 total days Most problems like this ask you to round to full days, so we round up to [B]37 days[/B].<br></p><a href=# title="Click to jump to zy-dm=ky/t for y lesson" id=tlink>zy-dm=ky/t for y</a><p>zy-dm=ky/t for y Isolate terms with y to solve this literal equation. Subtract zy from each side: zy - dm - zy = ky/t - zy Cancel the zy terms on the left side, we get: -dm = ky/t - zy Factor out y: y(k/t - z) = -dm Divide each side by (k/t - z) y = -dm/(k/t - z) (k/t - z) can be rewritten as (k - tz)/t We multiply -dm by the reciprocal of this quotient to get our simplified literal equation: y = [B]-dmt/(k - tz)[/B]<br></p><a href=# title="Click to jump to |(x-7)/5|=4 lesson" id=tlink>|(x-7)/5|&lt;=4</a><p>|(x-7)/5|&lt;=4 Set up two equations: [LIST=1] [*](x-7)/5 &lt;= 4 [*](x-7)/5 > -4 [/LIST] Cross Multiply (1): x - 7 &lt;= 20 Add 7 to each side: x &lt;= 27 Cross Multiply (2): x - 7 > -20 Add 7 to each side: x > -13<br></p><a href=# title="Click to jump to " id=tlink>The shortest person in a class is 55 inches tall and tallest person in that class is 75 inches tall</a><p>The shortest person in a class is 55 inches tall and tallest person in that class is 75 inches tall. write an absolute value equation that requires the minimum and maximum height.
