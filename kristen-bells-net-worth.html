Her father worked as a television news director in Las Vegas. Thus her family was slightly involved in the entertainment world.</p><p>Her mother was a registered nurse. Bell’s parents divorced when she was two years old. She has a lot of half-siblings because both of her parents remarried.</p><p>Bell graduated from Shrine Catholic School, a private school rather than a public high school, in 1998.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bell-young.png><p>During her stay at this private school, Kristen Bell developed an interest in theatre and acting, and she participated in several theater performances, typically as the lead.</p><p>Her enthusiasm for theater drove her to New York after graduation, where she majored in musical theater at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.</p><h2>Kristen Bell’s Net Worth and Income</h2><h3>Kristen Bell’s Net Worth</h3><p><strong>An American actress, singer, dancer, and film producer, Kristen Bell’s net worth is a staggering $40 million as of 2023.</strong></p><p>It’s safe to conclude that the animated musical from 2013 performed better than anyone expected. According to Forbes, the film grossed $1.3 billion at the box office and is expected to gross considerably more merchandise sales.</p><p><strong>Frozen 2</strong> opens in theaters on November 22, but the trailer alone has racked up millions of views, and whispers of a third box-office film are swirling over Arendelle like a snowstorm.</p><p>Not only did Kristen earn money from her first acting role, but the program also earned over $5 million on Kickstarter to fund a <strong>Veronica Mars</strong> film, and the show was renewed for a fourth season on Hulu this summer.</p><p>But, until then, Kristen may be seen in the last season of “<strong>The Good Place</strong>,” a half-hour comedy about ethics and what it means to be a good person.</p><p>Kristen has been playing major character Eleanor Shellstrop since 2016, and according to PopBuzz, she earns $125,000 every episode. If this is true, she will earn more than $5 million from the show’s 40+ episodes.</p><h3>Kristen Bell’s Income</h3><p>We believe Kristen made at least $3 million each year, based on $125,000 per episode of her sitcom The Good Place.</p><p>Kristen Bell makes $21,710 – $36,184 for every sponsored post on Instagram, where she has over 11 million followers.</p><h3>Kristen Bell’s Net Worth in Different Currencies</h3><p>Let’s take a look at Kristen Bell’s Net Worth in several currencies, including BitCoin, the cryptocurrency.</p><table class=mytable width=696><tbody><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Euro</strong></td><td>€ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":25594650}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")*R[-1]C[-1]'>34,124,200</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pound Sterling</strong></td><td>£ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":28907000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDGBP")*R[-2]C[-1]'>28,907,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Australian Dollar</strong></td><td>A$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":54447719.99999999}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDAUD")*R[-3]C[-1]'>54,447,720</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canadian Dollar</strong></td><td>C$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":50114000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDCAD")*R[-4]C[-1]'>50,114,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Indian Rupee</strong></td><td>₹ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":2977518000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDINR")*R[-5]C[-1]'>2,977,518,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>BitCoin</strong></td><td>฿ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":788.09395}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDBTC")*R[-6]C[-1]'>887</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Kristen Bell: House and Cars</h2><h3>House</h3><h4>Los Feliz Pad</h4><p>Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are the reigning couple goals in Hollywood, and they may soon be house goals as well. Angelina Jolie’s new home is in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles.</p><p>The Cecil B. DeMille residence, bought by the legendary director in 1916 and by Jolie in June of this year, is located in Los Feliz’s elite, gated Laughlin Park neighborhood.</p><p>According to the LA Times, the stars of “<strong>The Good Place</strong>” and “<strong>CHIPs</strong>” reportedly purchased a home on Laughlin Park Drive just over a quarter mile away for $4.3 million, making them the enclave’s second-largest property.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bell-stunning-house-1024x683.jpeg><p>The 4,048 square foot English Revival mansion, designed in 1922 by architect Arthur R. Kelly (renowned for the Playboy Mansion), features four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms.</p><p>According to the listing, the basement level would make a fantastic entertainment space or movie screening room, so Shepard might be able to put his La-Z-Boy down there.</p><p>According to the listing, the house lies on roughly an acre of walled-in grounds with mature and “majestic trees, vast lawns & vegetation.” A separate carriage house and garage, a motor court, and a pool with a hot tub are all included.</p><p>The property will be a bit of a fixer-upper unless they like that yellow kitchen. But we already know Bell is up for a project—in March of this year, she completed a complete remodel of her sister’s basement with the help of Houzz.</p><p>According to the LA Times, the property was last sold in February for $3.225 million.</p><h4>Hollywood Hills Home</h4><p>Kristen Bell’s Hollywood Hills home was built in 1969, according to Los Angeles County tax records. The actress purchased it through a trust for a whopping $3.1 million.</p><p>Interior decorator Stacey Vuduris gave the home a fantastic makeover. You’ll have to travel to the northeastern Santa Monica mountains in Los Angeles, California, to find the actress’ home.</p><p>The Mediterranean mansion is set among the wooded Hollywood Hills, just above Studio City, and is cut off from the noise and bustle of the city.</p><p>While tax records indicate a three-bedroom, three-bathroom manor, another media source claims that it has seven bedrooms and four bathrooms within its walls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kristen-bell-house.jpg><p>On the other hand, the reality appears to be in line with the taxman, with the 3,900 square-foot property being single-story.</p><p>The house has a great view of the city with a panoramic vista. Outside the house, there are well-kept grounds and a medium-sized pool with a Jacuzzi. The backyard is rocky, with jasmine, bougainvillea, and lavender was strewn about.</p><p>The entire yard appears to be a jungle gym. The house’s interiors are bright and magnificent. A long private drive goes up to the property, which is gated.</p><p>Green cloth covers the well-lit and spacious kitchen, which has white cabinets. A magnificent chandelier constructed of clustered globes hangs in the dining room. The faux suede and chrome chairs add to the elegant appearance.</p><p>This area is densely populated with celebrities. George Clooney, Michael Richards, Anna Nicole Smith, Selena Gomez, and Michael Richards are among the celebrities who have made their homes here.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Kristen Bell isn’t much of a car person, but she does own some of the luxury cars ever known. Some of them are listed below:</p><ul><li>Lincoln Continental</li><li>Lamborghini Aventador</li><li>Toyota Tacoma</li><li>Porsche Cayenne</li><li>Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster</li></ul><h4>Chevy Volt</h4><p>Kristen Bell, a talented actress, enjoys doing her part for the environment, and what better way to do so than by driving about in a hybrid-electric Chevrolet Volt.</p><p>Bell had her Volt personalized in a gorgeous midnight-black paint job, but she skipped the chromium-plated wheels and personalized seats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bell-Chevy-Volt-car.jpg><p>Bell’s Volt is as low-key as she is, but it can reach top speeds of 100 mph in all-electric mode, giving her a 30-mile range without needing any gasoline.</p><p>She obtains a 31.4 mpg fuel economy even when she doesn’t have the 3 hours it takes Volt to recharge her car batteries fully.</p><h2>Kristen Bell: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Bell’s remarkably thrifty lifestyle choices contribute significantly to the couple’s ability to maximize their savings. Shepard and Bell both come from low beginnings and lead simple lives. Can they get any more down-to-earth?</p><p>Bell claims they barely spent a little more than $100 on their wedding, including gas money. Bell is also a notorious couponer, claiming to do all of her shopping at a discount.</p><p>While she is obviously frugal, she is also the mother of two children and appears to provide a pleasant lifestyle for them.</p><p>It’s safe to suppose that the money they saved from coupons and reducing their overall personal expenses allowed them to purchase a lovely home to raise their family.</p><p>However, few brands that she is ever spotted on are given below.</p><h4>Brands</h4><p>In August 2012, Kirsten was seen wearing this colorful dress to the “Do Something” awards. It has a V-shaped neckline with black etched embellishments on the neckline and sleeves.</p><p>It has a distinctive design with double pockets on the front panel and abstract prints in yellow, pink, blue, and green.</p><p>The actress was caught wearing these pants to a New York film screening “Hit and Run.” It has 90% cotton and 10% spandex leather lining, a completely lined flexible Merlot leather interior, a cropped hem, and five pockets.</p><p>It’s a low-rise pant with stamp buttons and a hidden zip closing that comes in various colors.</p><p>Bell was photographed buying in these $500 expensive boots. It features genuine leather soles and Italian Cow leather in a padded calf leather footbed. It has a stylish design with a metallic collar button and an elastic strap closing at the ankles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bell-sunglasses-819x1024.jpg><p>While out and about, the musician has repeatedly flaunted her costly sunglasses. The frames are black and have lapis lazuli embedded in them.</p><p>It provides 100 percent UV protection and is guaranteed to be genuine because it comes directly from the manufacturer.</p><p>Kirsten wore these expensive $800 shoes to Los Angeles’ annual “A Night at Sardi’s” benefit event. The shoes are made in Italy and have colorful Mexibeads all over and their unique red lacquer sole.</p><p>At the 2012 CMT Music Awards, the actress wore this high-end purse. It is stylish with a rectangular gold-toned box with curving waterfall crystal channels and a designer shell crystal clasp.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>In September 2008, Kristen Bell was shot on the turquoise beaches of Hawaii. The actress and her boyfriend, actor Dax Shepard, spent roughly five days at the seaside resort.</p><p>Bell made the most of her vacation by splashing around in the crystal blue sea waves and sunning in a bikini.</p><p>Hawaii is an island state in the United States of America that the Pacific Ocean surrounds. Hawaii has over 400 hotels to select from, all with different price ranges.</p><p>Luxury 5-star resorts such as The Kahala Hotel and Resort, Turtle Bay Resort, and The Ritz-Carlton Kapalua can be quite pricey, ranging from $400 to $650 per night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bell-vacation-1024x1024.jpg><p>Budget hotels in Hawaii include The Hawaiian Monarch Hotel, Kauai Palms Hotel, Uncle Billy’s Hilo Bay Hotel, and Aston Aloha Beach Hotel, which charge modest rates ranging from $65 to $100 per day.</p><p>Every year, millions of tourists go to Hawaii’s beautiful sun-kissed beaches, which are by far the state’s most popular attraction.</p><p>The Volcano National Park is a one-of-a-kind tourist attraction that offers a spectacular view of numerous active and dormant volcanoes.</p><p>A golf course in Honolulu, Hawaii, set among the 2000-foot-high cliffs of the Ko’olau mountain range, which draws tens of thousands of golfers each year.</p><h2>Movie, Business Ventures, Endorsements, Tax & Insurance, Book Publications</h2><h3>Movie</h3><p>Kristen collaborated with Amy Poehler, Chris Lowell, Ted Danson, and Aziz Ansari on the shows <strong>Veronica Mars</strong> (2004-2007),<strong> Parks and Recreation</strong> (2013-2014), and <strong>The Good Place</strong> (2016-present).</p><p>Even though the actress has yet to reveal her earnings, she is undoubtedly worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. <strong>The Good Place</strong> pays Bell $125,000 per episode, according to sources.</p><p>Actors, on the other hand, earn an average of $50,000 a year. In addition, the actress appeared in the films <strong>Bad Moms</strong> (2016) and <strong>A Bad Moms Christmas</strong> (2017), which starred Mila Kunis and Kathryn Hahn.</p><p>Bell also provided the voice of Princess Anna in the Disney animated film <strong>Frozen</strong> (2013).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bell-on-movie.jpg><p>On a budget of $150 million, the film grossed $1.276 billion.
