There was no indication he was suicidal.”</p><p>Banerjee's story can now be seen in the <a href=#>true crime</a> mini-series Welcome To Chippendales, which premiered on <a href=#>Hulu</a> in November 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/mobile-twitter-com-stevebanerjee-media-777495021.jpg><h2>Does Somen Banerjee have children?</h2><p>Banerjee married his wife, Irene, in the 1980s and later welcomed two kids, Lindsay and Christian.</p><p>When Banerjee died, Irene was left with the kids and the family business, but she died in February 2001 after a battle with <a href=#>cancer</a>.</p><p>While Lindsay has stayed out of the spotlight over the years, Christian quickly followed in his family's legacy and became a male stripper.</p><p>Christian told the <a aria-label="The New York Post (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a> in March 2022: “It wasn’t the fact that I wanted to be a stripper. It was my destiny,.</p><p>“It wasn’t like I saw ‘Magic Mike’ and wanted to emulate what I’ve seen. This came from a much deeper place in my soul.”</p><p>Along with being a male stripper, Christian is also the founder of Strippendales and hopes to continue his father's legacy.</p><p>Christian continued: “Nobody was brave enough to send out male strippers. And nobody monetized it like my father did.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"...I’ve always had this connection with my dad, even though he wasn’t living, through Chippendales.</p><p>"I think he’d want to push me in this direction.
