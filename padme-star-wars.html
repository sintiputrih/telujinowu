Here is an explanation of Padmé and Anakin’s age disparity. Audiences were already familiar with Anakin prior to the release of the prequels, but Padmé, Anakin’s childhood sweetheart and eventual wife, was introduced to the public in George Lucas’ second Star Wars trilogy, which starred Natalie Portman as Padmé. Although Padmé and Anakin’s ages were significantly different between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, a passion nevertheless grew between them.</p><p>During a visit to Tatooine, the Queen of Naboo first encountered Anakin, and it didn’t take him long to fall in love with her. Anakin continued to be smitten with Padmé when they ran into one other again ten years later, proving that his crush didn’t end there. Even if the prequels’ execution of the narrative arc and Portman and Hayden Christensen’s onscreen chemistry weren’t always successful, the tragic love tale between Padmé and Anakin served as their central theme. However, one facet of the romance that is frequently explored is the way that Old Padmé is contrasted with Anakin.</p><p>Here’s a quick recap of their ages and the timeframe before we get into the intricacies of Padmé and Anakin’s age differences in each of the prequels and how they compare to one another. Padmé is five years older than Anakin because she was born in 46 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), whereas Anakin was miraculously formed in 41 BBY. They don’t actually meet until 32 BBY, in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Anakin Skywalker is just 9 years old during the events of the film, whereas Padmé is 14 at the time. At this point, Anakin’s crush on the woman he believes to be an angel is very innocent and is not shared by Padmé.</p><h3>How Old Is Padmé Compared To Anakin In The Prequels<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anakin-Padme-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>During Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, which takes place in 22 BBY, Anakin and Padmé are reunited ten years later. Due to the time shift, Padmé is now 24 years old, whereas Anakin is still a young adolescent at the age of 19. Padmé and Anakin’s romance begins during this challenging time in their life, therefore their age gap does not prevent it. By the end of the film, they had secretly wed, which forces them to maintain their secrecy for the following three years until Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Padmé is 27 years old and a well-respected political figure when the prequels begin up their story in 19 BBY, while Anakin’s Dark Side turn is set to occur at age 22.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u98c54ab88b0964743834954b2caf90ec><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Best Padme Amidala Costumes In Star Wars You Can Wear This Halloween</span></a><h3>How Old Were Padmé and Anakin When They Got Married<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anakin-marries-Padme-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>A Jedi attack team and the Grand Army of the Republic help Anakin and Padmé escape from Geonosis at the conclusion of Attack of the Clones. The two were getting married at Varykino, a lake resort on Naboo, while the Jedi High Council thought Anakin was just escorting the Queen back to her house. Given that Attack of the Clones takes place in the year 22 BBY, Padmé and Anakin marry when they are both 24 years old. The two’s marriage and connection are interestingly shown in the prequels. Palpatine’s assurance that he would prevent Amidala’s death finally convinced Skywalker to turn to the Dark Side while he was still considering it.</p><h3>How Old Was Padmé When She Died In Revenge Of The Sith?<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Padmes-coffin-in-Revenge-of-the-Sith-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Given that Padmé’s journey ends with her death at the end of the Star Wars prequels at the age of just 27, the age gap between Anakin and Padmé was ultimately unimportant. Before she lost the will to live, she spent her final moments giving birth to Luke and Leia. Anakin believed that discovering the Dark Side may save Padmé, but in the end, it was his decision that led her to give up on living. Following the release of Revenge of the Sith, there was considerable debate regarding Padmé’s passing. She allegedly passed away from a shattered heart after learning that Anakin had completed his Sith change, according to the film. She so passes away while being in good health physically because she “loses the will to live.” Many believed that how she died devalued her tale and that George Lucas’ actions may have even been sexist.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u76478d35bf45e97db41feed448e9db75><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>20 Actors Who Starred In Both Star Wars & Star Trek - The Elite List Continues</span></a><p>Other hate-driven characters were allowed to live out their lives well past the age of 27, indicating that hate drives people to live longer lives than love does in Lucas’ planet. After all, Darth Vader was 45 and Darth Maul was 52 years old when the Emporer Palpatine passed away, making him the oldest person ever. The Star Wars prequels may have required Padmé’s death, but the way she passed away feels like a disappointing plot blunder. The age discrepancy between Padmé and Anakin has generated some debate. Despite having a 5-year age difference, Anakin was regrettably given the opportunity to catch up to Amidala following the latter’s untimely death.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
