She went to Appleton Hall High School, a public comprehensive school in Appleton, Warrington, which had previously been a grammar school.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Rebekah Brooks Children: Meet Scarlett Anne Mary Brooks</a></h4><p>She was charming, always able to get what she wanted out of people, and “more emotionally bright than academic,” according to a childhood acquaintance named Louise Weir.</p><p>Although Brooks claimed to have studied at the Sorbonne in Paris in her Who’s Who profile, she did not claim to have a degree and did not thereafter respond to inquiries concerning this. Stephen Glover alleged that she was employed by the News of the World at the age of 20 in a 2003 Spectator piece.</p><p>For his services to journalism, Brooks received an honorary Fellowship from the University of the Arts, London, in 2010. She did not complete her studies while she was a student at the now-integrated London College of Communication.</p><p>Henry Porter, a pundit, asserts that nothing is known about Brooks personally. Tim Minogue, one of her first co-editors at Private Eye magazine before going into journalism, remembered her as a “likable, thin, hollow-eyed girl who was really ambitious.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rebekah Brooks career</h2><p>Brooks spent her post-school years working in Paris for the French publication L’architecture d’aujourd’hui before moving back to the UK to join Eddy Shah’s Messenger Group. Graham Ball, the features editor of The Post at the time, remembered her as a very sharp and clever employee.</p><p>Brooks then shifted to the News of the World once The Post was shut down. In 1989, Brooks began working as a secretary for the Sunday daily News of the World. Later, she began writing features for the publication’s magazine and rose to the position of deputy editor.</p><p>She moved to The Sun, the News of the World’s daily rival, for a brief period of time in 1998. She later made a comeback to the News of the World in 2000 as editor, becoming the paper’s youngest editor at the time.</p><p>She replaced her former employer David Yelland as The Sun’s first female editor in January 2003. Rebekah Parmar-Teasdale was the Page 3 girl on Brooks’ first day as editor; the picture’s caption read, “Rebekah from Wapping.”</p><p>Soon after taking over as editor, Brooks published the headline “Bonkers Bruno Locked Up” on Frank Bruno, a former heavyweight boxing champion, and his mental health issues.</p><p>As part of a probe into privacy issues, Brooks testified in front of the House of Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media, and Sport in March 2003 that her publication had paid the police for information.</p><p>The judge for the tenth annual Police Bravery Awards in July 2005, which were sponsored by The Sun, and the “Guardian Student Media Awards” in November 2003, Brooks is the chairperson of the group Women in Journalism.</p><p>It was revealed in June 2009 that she would go from The Sun in September to take the helm of News International, the corporation that owns the newspaper. She appointed Dominic Mohan as The Sun’s editor in her place.</p><p>For quitting News International, Brooks received £10.8 million. Brooks was reappointed as CEO of News UK, now known as News International, in September 2015.</p><p>In 2003, Brooks and Andy Coulson were questioned by Chris Bryant MP of the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee about whether either of their newspapers had ever engaged in any wrongdoing.</p><p>In 2011, The Guardian and a lawyer claimed that in 2002, when Brooks was editor, the newspaper had hacked Milly Dowler’s voicemail to acquire messages left by her parents. Milly Dowler was eventually discovered to have been killed.</p><p>Following the Milly Dowler allegations, Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, said in July 2011 that Brooks should “examine her position.” According to Prime Minister David Cameron, he would have accepted Brooks’ resignation if she had submitted it to him. The parents of Milly Dowler also demanded that Brooks step down.</p><p>Brooks was reappointed as CEO of the business, now known as News UK, in September 2015. It was reported that she would join the board of directors at Tremor International Limited in January 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Rebekah Brooks’ parents?</h2><p>Brooks was born to John Robert Wade and Deborah Wade. She is likely to be the only child of her parents as there is no records that suggests she has any siblings.</p><p>Her parents were running a tree pruning business together and using that to support their family until her father died at the age of 50 in 1996.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqucm52blrVurtGopqSrXaWus7HNrapo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1416472-sgt-slaughter-explains-why-he-copyrighted-cobra-clutch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sgt.
