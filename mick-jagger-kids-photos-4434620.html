Like many of his older siblings, he appears to be pursuing a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>career in modeling</a>. In April 2021, he gave fans a glimpse at his post-op recovery, after undergoing surgery on his ears. He took to Instagram and posted a series of photos from his stay in the hospital. The first image in the carousel post featured Lucas with bandages wrapped around his head and an oxygen tube in his nose. The youngster looked like the spitting image of his famous father from decades ago, with his hair totally tussled and his smirking expression highlighting the clear resemblance between Mick and Lucas.</p><h2>Deveraux</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mick-Jagger-Kids-Everything-To-Know-embed-8.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mick’s youngest son</a>, whom he shares with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Melanie Hamrick</strong></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Deveraux Octavian Basil Jagger</strong>, was&nbsp;born in December 2016. In July 2016, he stunned fans when it was revealed that his then 29-year-old girlfriend was pregnant with his eighth child, and they were equally surprised when the couple revealed their bub’s&nbsp;very&nbsp;unique name. However, Basil was actually Mick’s late father’s first name, and Octavian means “born eighth” in Latin.
