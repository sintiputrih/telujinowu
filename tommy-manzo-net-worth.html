Tommy Manzo earned his net worth as co-owner of The Brownstone restaurant in New Jersey. Tommy was formerly married to <a href=#>Dina Manzo</a>, who was an original cast member of the Bravo reality series "The Real Housewives of New Jersey." Unlike the husbands of many of the "Real Housewives," Tommy never appeared on the show.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Tommy Manzo was born Thomas Manzo in 1965 in New York. According to a 2009 "Daily Beast" article, Tommy's father, Albert "Tiny" Manzo, "ended his life naked, bound in plastic, and stuffed in the trunk of a Lincoln Continental with four slugs in his chest" in 1983. Tommy and his brother, Albert, inherited The Brownstone after their father's murder. Albert is married to Dina's sister Caroline, who also starred on "The Real Housewives of New Jersey."</p><h2 id=reality-career><strong>Reality Career</strong></h2><p>In 2007, Tommy and Dina's wedding was featured on the VH1 series "My Fabulous Wedding." The wedding had over 600 guests, cost $1.1 million, and included the "biggest cake anyone has ever seen." Manzo and his brother, Albert, run The Brownstone, a "premier catering and event planning company" in Paterson, New Jersey. Established by Tom and Rita Clune in 1947, The Brownstone is said to be "the first known non-hotel catering facility in the country." Tommy and Albert's father washed dishes at the venue in the 1960s, and he bought The Brownstone in the late '70s after the Clunes decided to retire.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-345376 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tommy-Manzo-scaled.jpg alt="Tommy Manzo" width=900 height=1491 sizes="(max-width: 1545px) 100vw, 1545px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-345376 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Steven A Henry/WireImage)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Tommy married Claudine Laurita (better known as "Dina") on August 11, 2005, and he was stepfather to Lexi, Dina's daughter from her marriage to <a href=# title="George Hadjiapostoli Net Worth">George Hadjiapostoli</a>. Dina announced that she and Tommy were separating in 2013, but the pair continued to live together with her daughter in the home they shared in New Jersey until officially divorcing in 2016. Rumors of infidelity are the cause for the couple's demise, and it has been said that Tommy had been cheating on Dina for quite some time.</p><p>After the divorce, Dina began a relationship with David Cantin, and in May 2021, Tommy was arrested for allegedly organizing a 2017 home invasion in which Dina was thrown on the floor and kicked as her $60,000 engagement ring was stolen and David was beaten with a baseball bat. In May 2019, James Mainello was arrested for the crime, and it wasn't until two years later that Manzo was indicted as an accomplice in the attack. Both men were charged with burglary, robbery, criminal restraint, aggravated assault, and weapons offenses, and Tommy was also charged with stalking Dina and David.</p><p>Tommy had previously been arrested in June 2020 for ordering an attack on Cantin in a strip mall parking lot in 2015. Mobster John Perna was arrested for carrying out the attack, and he reportedly did it in exchange for a discounted wedding reception at The Brownstone. Manzo pleaded not guilty to charges of committing a violent crime in aid of racketeering, falsifying records, and assault with a dangerous weapon and was released on $100,000 bail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR706ikprFdoq6vxs5mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-gracie-abrams-the-daughter-of.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Gracie Abrams the daughter of?">&larr;
