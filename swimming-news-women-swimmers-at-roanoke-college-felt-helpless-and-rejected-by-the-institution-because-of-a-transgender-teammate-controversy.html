The athletes openly revealed their emotions and voiced their dissatisfaction and discontent regarding the inclusion of a transgender woman in their team, who had previously competed as a man.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In discussing her male teammate’s decision to participate in the competition alongside her and the other female swimmers, Bailey Gallagher, a 21-year-old swimmer, spoke with both surprise and an unpreparedness for such a scenario. Initially, Gallagher and her teammates had no objections to the transgender swimmer’s decision to transition. However, at present, they sense that their achievements and triumphs are being overlooked.</p><p>The event was called “NCAA – Save Women’s Sports”. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Riley Gaines</strong></a>, a renowned swimmer, was part of the discussion and expressed her disagreement towards transgender women participating in sports. Additionally, Paula Scanlan, a former swimmer from UPenn, shared her concerns about sharing a locker room with a transgender female swimmer.</p><p>A large number of female athletes are expressing anxiety over the ongoing debate regarding transgender women participating in sports. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I</a>n her compelling address atthe <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">press conference</a>, Gaines delved into the sentiments and manipulation faced by women pursuing fairness in sports. She highlighted that advocating for equal treatment of women and girls should not demand bravery or courage. The athletes were dissatisfied because they did not receive adequate assistance from their school, coach, and the NCAA.</p><p>They experienced abandonment and disregard while seeking equitable treatment. Her decision to quit the Roanoke College swim team is thought to have been influenced by the upcoming press conference.</p><p>Our team leaders, including <strong>Kate Pearson</strong>, <strong>Lily Mullens</strong>, and <strong>Bailey Gallagher</strong>, stated that the problem resulted in a major divide within our Division III team, leading to a lack of support. Although they asserted their lack of ill intentions, they admitted feeling uneasy about having a team member who was assigned male at birth.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Not kind to ask a girl to undress in front of a man,” Riley Gaines again targets Megan Rapinoe over her stance on Trans supporting bill in female sports</a></p><p>It was a completely distinct experience at the news conference compared to the usual climate of fear and silence when discussing the involvement of transgender women in women’s sports. Due to fear of social exclusion and retaliation, many swimmers and their parents opted to keep their identities undisclosed during previous interviews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Q_1696416597.jpg><p>Highlighting the event’s utmost importance, Kara Dansky, head of the Women’s Declaration International in the US, emphasized its significance. It was the first instance where an entire women’s team had united to oppose men’s involvement in women’s sports, she noted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Soooooo proud to stand with <a href=#>@RoanokeCollege</a> women's swim team today as they held a press conference calling for the NCAA, their university, and lawmakers to implement policies to protect women's sports!!</p><p>How many more girls have to lose out on opportunities for us to say "NO"? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/h7nRig99qK</a></p>— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) <a href=#>October 5, 2023</a></figure><p>Officials from Roanoke College have stated that a transgender student who previously took a year off from the men’s team is now interested in joining the women’s swim team. The college employed its protocols and principles to conclude. Riley Gaines and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paula Scanlan</a> were lauded by Kara Dansky for their boldness and steadfastness. She highlighted how the female athletes were treated badly and made to doubt their own concerns.</p><p>In an effort to advocate for equality in women’s sports, these women chose to express their anger and convey their message during the press conference. The narratives they share demonstrate the challenges that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">female athletes </a>may face with the inclusion of transgender competitors.</p><p>The current discussion regarding this issue emphasizes the significance of implementing impartial and all-encompassing regulations that maintain fairness in women’s sports and uphold the rights and identities of transgender individuals.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK570rCgpqWZo7RuusSwqmavn6Kyr3nSsKCmpZWnwG6t02apqJmepLimecKoo6Wdl5p6p7HLrWShnZyluaa%2F0maYp5xdp7KrscKtnJ1lkq56tbTEZqCnq6SewbbAyKilZpqVmK62v8Rmpp9lkWLBs63NrJ6eppSav27AxJqkppmkmnqku82tqaiulafAuns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brady-hepner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brady Hepner">&larr;
