He attended Vaughan Secondary School in Ontario, where he led his high school team to an undefeated season and the provincial championship in his senior year. His impressive performances caught the attention of many college basketball coaches in the United States, and he ultimately committed to playing for the University of Kansas.</p><p>During his time at Kansas, Wiggins established himself as one of the top players in the country. He earned several awards and accolades, including the Big 12 Freshman of the Year and the First-Team All-Big 12 honors. His strong performances in college made him a highly sought-after prospect in the 2014 NBA draft.</p><p>Wiggins was selected as the first overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers but was immediately traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a trade deal for Kevin Love. In his rookie season, Wiggins averaged 16.9 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Wiggins</a> continued to improve in his subsequent seasons with the Timberwolves, and in 2017, he signed a five-year, $148 million contract extension with the team. However, despite his strong individual performances, the Timberwolves struggled to make the playoffs, and Wiggins was eventually traded to the Golden State Warriors in 2020.</p><p>Since joining the Warriors, Wiggins has continued to be a key contributor to the team’s success. He has shown versatility on both ends of the court, with his ability to score from a variety of positions and defend multiple positions. His strong performances have helped the Warriors remain competitive in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p><p>Off the court, Wiggins is known for his philanthropic work and dedication to social justice issues. He has supported several organizations, including the Boys and Girls Club and the Covenant House, and has been vocal about issues such as police brutality and racial inequality.</p><p>Overall, Andrew Wiggins’ natural talent and hard work have made him one of the top basketball players in the world. His strong performances both on and off the court have earned him a reputation as a role model and leader in the basketball community. With many years of playing ahead of him, it is clear that Wiggins will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in the NBA.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Andrew Wiggins ever play for the Cavs?</h2><p>Andrew Wiggins was drafted first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2014 NBA Draft. He played for the Cavaliers in the 2014 NBA Summer League, where he showed flashes of his potential as a scorer and a defender. However, before the start of the regular season, Wiggins was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a deal to acquire Kevin Love.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The trade was completed on August 23, 2014, with the Cavaliers sending Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, and a protected 2015 first-round pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for Love. The deal was seen as a win-win for both teams, as the Cavaliers acquired an All-Star power forward to pair with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, while the Timberwolves got a promising young player in Wiggins and a future first-round pick.</p><p>Wiggins played his rookie season with the Timberwolves and won the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2015. He spent five seasons with the Timberwolves before being traded to the Golden State Warriors in 2020. So, while Wiggins was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers, he never played any regular-season games for the team as he was traded to the Timberwolves before the season began.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2gnWWRo7GzsdZmrqKfl567tHnEr5yrZaChrrp5xaipZqyYmnqkrdWsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./intel-z390-motherboard-overview-every-motherboard-analyzed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="GIGABYTE Z390 Aorus Elite - Intel Z390 Motherboard Overview: 50+ Motherboards Analyzed">&larr;
