I want to take my relationship to the next step, as well. I don’t mind becoming a father. I want to be a young dad.”</strong></p><p>In a video that Spears posted following the engagement, she is seen showing off her new ring, designed by N.Y.C. jeweler Roman Malayev, with the caption, “<strong>I can’t f***ing believe it 💍💍💍💍💍💍❣️!!!!!!”</strong></p><p>It is still unclear when the two plan to walk down the aisle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Does Sam Asghari Do For His Living?</h2><p>Britney Spears’ boyfriend, Sam Asghari, is a personal trainer. According to their site, the fitness guru is the owner and founder of Asghari Fitness, a members-only program that provides clients with a personalized diet and workout plans.</p><p>Asghari’s plan begins at $9 per week, which amounts to around $468 per year per client. It’s not clear how large Asghari’s client base is, but with over 21,000 <a href=#>followers on Instagram</a>, we imagine it’s large enough to make him a generous salary each year. But this is not the only way Asghari has made his money.</p><p>While Asghari is not a direct beneficiary of Britney Spears’ conservatorship, he has worked with the singer in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>The workout junkie is also a professional model, actor, and dancer—and in October 2016, he met Britney while playing the love interest in her “Slumber Party” music video.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple started dating soon after. Since then, Asghari has appeared in TV drama NCIS, Showtime comedy series Black Monday, and HBO’s Hacks, among others, while working on his fitness company.</p><p>After Asghari and Spears announced their engagement in September 2021, many fans grew concerned that Spears might be taken advantage of financially unless she entered into a prenuptial agreement with her husband-to-be.&nbsp;</p><p>Asghari put fans’ concerns to rest in an Instagram Story at the time, confirming that he and Britney will sign an “iron-clad prenup.” He also joked that the legal document protected his “jeep and shoe collection” rather than her assets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sam Asghari Net Worth</h2><p>Sam Asghari’s net worth is calculated to be $2 million. He is an actor, personally trained, based in the United States. After confirming his relationship with <a href=#>American singer Britney Spears</a>, Sam came into the limelight.&nbsp;</p><p>As of 2022, his annual income is $250k and is increasing day by day. Sam wasn’t born into a wealthy family. However, he has made all his money through hard work and commitment. Sam and Britney’s spears’ total net worth is around $62 million and more.</p><p>Sam earns most of his income by being a personal trainer, and he runs a family fitness program only for his clients. Along with his manager, he creates and plans diet charts and offers personalized workout plans for his clients.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam charges around $9 per week for his customized program. And gets $36 per month from each client.&nbsp;</p><p>According to various sources, there are around 25k people who have joined his fitness program. Apart from being a trainer, he is also an actor and model and earns a good amount of money from his acting profession.&nbsp;</p><p>Being a celebrity and influencer, he has achieved more than 2 million followers on his social media. He promotes brands such as Snow, 1st Phrom, etc., through his social media.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2FwKZkmquXna6ztYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./booboo-stewart-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Booboo Stewart Net Worth">&larr;
