And if you loved the show, chances are you're trying to figure out <a href=# class=T3D>how to dress like Barb from <i>Stranger Things</i> for Halloween</a>. Barb didn't appear in too many episodes of the show, but when she did, a lot of us flashed back to our own high school moments, realizing that Barb was pretty much the person we used to be — and based on that, she's a solid choice if you're looking for a <a href=# class=T3D><i>Stranger Things</i> -themed Halloween costume</a> this year.</p><p>First, let's chat about why Barb is a great choice. While friendship was a key element of the show, it's often shown between Eleven and Mike — after all, Mike tells Eleven what being a friend truly means. "A friend is someone that you’d do anything for … and they never break a promise," he says. "That’s super important because friends tell each other things; things that parents don’t know." Friends don't lie to each other, and friends always look out for each other — I mean, it's pretty much why the kids are so set on finding Will on their own regardless of the dangers ahead, because Will is part of their team.</p><p>Barb pretty much did the exact same thing for Nancy. She went to a party she was uncomfortable at, made sure <a href=# class=T3D>Nancy was as safe as she could be</a>, and eventually (and unknowingly) put herself at risk. While the friendship seemed pretty one-sided at first, it was obvious that Nancy did have a ton of respect for her as well, later on — especially when she started venturing away from the boy-crush mode she found herself in. Thus, while Barb wasn't the star of the show, she's definitely a character worth portraying.</p><p>Here's what you need to be Barb for Halloween.</p><h3>1. The Glasses</h3><p>The first noticeable accessory that Barb wears? Her glasses. While the look is retro today, they were all the rage a few decades ago — which, thankfully, makes them not super hard to find.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Round Retro Orange Glasses</b> </a><b>, $10, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Amazon</b></a></p><p>Your best bet would be these round frames from <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sunglass Stop Shop</a>, in Frost Orange. At $10 on <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a>, they're the perfect price to tie your Halloween costume together. For a much bolder orange (or, if you're looking to portray a cartoony version of Barb),</p><h3>2. The hair</h3><p>The next noticeable thing about Barb is her hair. As a short-haired redhead, you might not naturally fit her description, so a wig is probably necessary. (And to all of those out there with short red hair? Lucky for you, you can totally skip right ahead to No. 3.)</p><p>So, as it turns out, Barb's exact style is tough to find. Barb doesn't have much hair to work with, and the purpose of a wig is to, well, showcase a lot of hair. So the best contender is likely this short red wig from <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>AliExpress</a>.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Light Red Color Synthetic Wigs For Women</b></a><b>, $13, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>AliExpress</b></a></p><p>You can snatch this wig up for under $20, which in the land of wigs, is pretty much a steal.</p><h3>3. The wardrobe</h3><p>Barb's clothes were pretty casual. But, one thing was made certain — she preferred shirts with a bit of a frill to the collar. It seemed like all of her shirts had this special, added detail — and it's one you definitely don't want to miss, if you want to be a successful Halloween Barb.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Light Blue Blouse</b></a><b>, $14, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Etsy</b></a></p><p>One amazing place to look? Etsy. The vintage shirt above, available from <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>treaclebeardvintage</a>, is totally Barb. Of course, the trouble with vintage clothes on Etsy is that they're not widely available, and might not come in your size.</p><p>Luckily, the same store offers a few items that fit the "frilly blouse" requirement. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Here's another</a>, in a pattern that your inner-Barb will truly love.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Striped Blue Blouse</b></a><b>, $14, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Etsy</b></a></p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Light Blue Blouse</b></a><b>, $14, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Etsy</b></a></p><p>If it's got a bit of hidden flare, it'll totally work.</p><p>As for Barb's pants, they seemed to be stretchy, high-waisted khakis. If you're a fan of jeggings, you can <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>pick these up at Kohl's</a> for about $25.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Juniors' SO® Perfectly Soft High-Waisted Ankle Jeggings</b></a><b>, $25, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Kohls</b></a></p><p>Or, if you're looking for pants that you'll get some real use out of after Halloween (or just happen to be anti-jeggings), you can pick up some of these <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>ankle pants from The Limited</a>.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Exact Stretch High Waist Skinny Ankle Pants</b></a><b>, $45, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>The Limited</b></a></p><p>Blouses: All blouses featured from<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> <b>treaclebeardvintage</b></a> are $12-$14, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Etsy</b></a></p><p>Pants: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Juniors' SO® Perfectly Soft High-Waisted Ankle Jeggings</b></a><b>, $25, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Kohls</b></a><b>; </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Exact Stretch High Waist Skinny Ankle Pants</b></a><b>, $45, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>The Limited</b></a></p><h3>4. Accessories</h3><p>So, congrats — you're super close to being Barb. But, of course it's not Halloween without a prop or two. As we know, Barb's moment of terror happened all thanks to a beer can trick gone wrong. When we last saw Barb, she was bleeding from the hand — so, obviously you'll want to include a bit of gauze (or tissues to be more accurate, but that'll be a bit messier to deal with at <a href=# class=T3D>a Halloween party</a>) and fake blood.</p><p>Of course, you can pick both up from CVS or Walgreens (in the medical supply aisle, and the seasonal aisle, of course). Or, you could grab a few tissues from home, and whip up your own batch of fake blood based on things you already have in the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>Not only is Steve Spangler's recipe above pretty realistic looking, but it's also edible. Barb would probably approve.</p><p><i>Main image: Netflix</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhJJraWxlkWKvor7BZp2rp51iwLW%2BwKeenqpdqbWqusasZKGZnKG8uLHEp2Scp6Opwq6xjKKbnpldm7yzeZFpaG9lpJ2utXnIrGSpnaKbsqTAy7JkqKZdpbyqutM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./did-travis-mullins-propose-to-gina-kirschenheiter-the-rhoc-star-spills-the-tea.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Travis Mullins propose to Gina Kirschenheiter?
