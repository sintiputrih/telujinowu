Needless to say, having Bullock in a movie can certainly attract a big audience.</p><p>In recent years, the mother-of-two has also been focusing her attention on holding the producer title on movies such as Netflix’s Bird Box and 2015’s Our Brand Is Crisis, which gives off the impression that she’s venturing out into different positions in filmmaking, and she’s earning big bucks while doing just that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated September 2023:</strong> While Sandra Bullock has had a successful professional life, as of late, her personal life has taken a hit.</p><p>Bullock's long-time partner, Bryan Randall, passed away in August 2023 from a three-year battle with ALS. The two began dating in 2015, shortly after Randall, who was a professional photographer, took pictures of Bullock's son, Louis' birthday party. <a href=#>He had become a parent to Bullock's children</a> and Bullock one for Randall's daughter.</p><p>From a professional standpoint, Bullock is in the coveted position to be able to take films as she would like to. As such, the last film Bullock appeared in was Bullet Train in 2022. However, she does have a film in pre-production that will likely get off the ground in short order, becoming yet another way for Bullock to add to her already massive net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=starring-in-successful-films-made-sandra-bullock-a-lot-of-money>Starring In Successful Films Made Sandra Bullock A Lot Of Money</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51329954-1.jpg><p>Most of her earnings come from her acting career, which gained a lot of attention following her supporting role in the action film Demolition Man in 1993.</p><p>Bullock has come a long way from the low-budget movies she was featured in back in the early ‘90s. By the time she landed the role of Annie in Speed, she was paid $500,000. While that was a lot of money at the time, it is nowhere near as much as she makes per film these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sandra Bullock Shocked Everyone When She Started Speaking Fluent German During A Candid Interview</a></span></p><p>It’s worth mentioning that for Speed 2: Cruise Control, which was released in 1997, Bullock had now earned an incredible $11 million per movie before going on to make $12.5 million for 2000's 28 Days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The numbers just kept on increasing until she landed her biggest deal to date.</p><p>Given her impressive record at the box office, the now 59-year-old had no problem commanding higher salaries than some of her industry peers, <strong>such as the time she made $20 million for starring in 2013’s Gravity</strong>.</p><p>Bullock must’ve been relieved to have a great agent negotiating her contracts because not only did she receive a payment of $20 million to star in the movie, but her deal also included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15% of the revenue earned at the box office</a>, pushing her overall earnings from the highly-acclaimed motion picture to $70 million!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sarah Paulson And Sandra Bullock Once Bonded Over This Sad Experience</a></span></p><p>Making that much for just one movie was unheard of at the time unless you include Robert Downey Jr., who was averaging at around $50 million per Avengers movie, but Bullock proved herself to be worth every penny as the film went on to gross over $720 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>In 2010, Bullock won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2009’s The Blind Side, which earned her $17 million</strong>, on top of backend earnings from profits made at the box office. As such, she’s no stranger to getting the best deal out of her contracts, and she goes home with a reputable prize to boot.</p><p>As previously mentioned, Bullock’s career has slowed down a little over the past couple of years as she’s raising her two children while producing and starring in a movie every now and again. Given the money she’s made, however the A-list star is in no rush to find herself another blockbuster hit.</p><p>However, Bullock could not say no to starring as Debbie Ocean in Ocean's 8 before moving to work on projects on streaming platforms, which have proven to be successful for Bullock as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=working-with-streaming-platforms-has-been-financially-lucrative-for-sandra-bullock>Working With Streaming Platforms Has Been Financially Lucrative For Sandra Bullock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/th-image-template-3-1.jpg><p>After concluding Ocean's 8, Bullock took her shot at success by bringing a film to the small screen as a Netflix original. Success did not elude Bullock as the film, Bird Box became an instant hit on the platform, after it was announced by the streaming giant that the film had been watched by more than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">45 million accounts in its first seven days.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sandra Bullock Has Had Multiple Stalkers, And Restraining Orders Didn't Prevent A Tragedy</a></span></p><p>“Took off my blindfold this morning to discover that 45,037,125 Netflix accounts have already watched Bird Box,” a tweet from Netflix’s official Twitter account read. “Best first 7 days ever for a Netflix film!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though the film was released five years ago, it remains one of the most popular Netflix films when counting streaming hours. A fact that helped Bullock make money not only for starring in front of the camera but for being a producer on it as well.</p><h2 id=sandra-bullock-39-s-production-company-makes-a-small-fortune>Sandra Bullock's Production Company Makes A Small Fortune</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/premiere-of-the-unforgiven.jpg><p>Bullock founded her own production company in 1995. While the production company was credited for films like Miss Congeniality and Hope Floats, it was not until 2002 that Bullock saw a real return on her producing investment. A return that added a big chunk to Bullock's net worth.</p><p>In 2002, Bullock began producing The George Lopez Show through her production company, Fortis Films. <strong>This led to Bullock earning $10 million over the course of the show's tenure</strong>, something that was not heard of often at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bullock also produced Bird Box. It was the highest-grossing film to achieve a feat of 45 downloads in just one week for the company. Though the salary was never disclosed, it’s fair to assume that Bullock most likely earned anything above $20 million for this project too and perhaps even more since she produced the film.</p><p>Bullock also produced and starred in The Unforgivable and The Lost City, both of which did well with fans. The Unforgivable was in Netflix's top 10 most-watched titles of all time and The Lost City grossed nearly $200 million at the box office.</p><p>When your name and acting skills can command impressive salaries such as Bullock’s, there’s no need to be chasing film after film. She certainly seems to have played her cards very well in Hollywood, and her earnings are certainly proving just that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be fair, if she decided to retire from acting in the near future and never worked in Hollywood again, she'd have enough money to last a lifetime, that's for sure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqaUp65urtSlo6ibm2K1or%2BMmmShrZeaenOBj2akoqScnryvec2eq2avn6fBqXnHnqmeq12dvLh50qGcZqWRmbJutMSrZKannprGcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-an-example-of-a-state-statute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is an example of a state statute?">&larr;
