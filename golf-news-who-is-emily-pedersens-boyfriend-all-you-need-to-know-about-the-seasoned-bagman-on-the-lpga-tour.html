With five wins in the European Tour, she has also made her mark at the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Solheim Cup</a>. The three-time Solheim Cupper brought home 2.5 points from five appearances this year. A slight glance at her personal life also confirms she has not turned her gaze much beyond the greens.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Danish star’s current boyfriend is associated with golf as well. Although not a professional golfer himself, the experienced bagman is a familiar name in the golf world. Most famous for his long partnership with an American LPGA pro, he helped her win five career victories. Who is the experienced caddie?</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Who is Emily Pederson’s Boyfriend?</b></h2><p><span>Emily Pederson, the Danish LPGA star, has a British boyfriend who mostly caddies for LPGA stars on the other side of the Atlantic. Olly Brett has been caddying for nearly a decade in the LPGA tour.</span></p><p><span>The Leicester native has looped for Mel Reid, Sandra Gal, Steve Lewton, and Espen Kofstad. For a brief period, he has also caddied for his girlfriend, Emily Pedersen. But most famously, he has been the bagman of Danielle <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Kang</a> for five years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br><span>It was during that time, he faced his girlfriend on the other side. At the Aberdeen Standard Investments Ladies Scottish Open in 2020, Pedersen found her partner on the opposing side. That was only the first time though. A year later, once again Kang and Pedersen faced each other. This time, on the prestigious Solheim Cup.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>When Pedersen found her boyfriend on the opposing side</b></h2><p><span>September 2021, Inverness Club, Toledo. It’s the Monday singles on American soil and the home side is on the losing end. The victory for the European team is all but sealed. However, on the course, Emily Pedersen is jockeying with Danielle Kang for the final match.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It was also a repeat of the 2017 Des Moines singles, where the American LPGA Pro got the better of the Dane. This time, however, Pedersen decided to change the narrative, as she defeated the 31-year-old American in the 18th hole with a birdie putt.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Europe team members gathered around the 27-year-old star, as they started celebrating. However, if you zoomed out from the boisterous bunch, you would have spotted one European star slowly walking away from the party.</span></p><p><span>Pedersen was walking towards the US side to console her boyfriend. Olly Brett at that time had been caddying for the player she just defeated. Pedersen revealed that her boyfriend wanted to win for the USA, obviously. But he congratulated her on her victory nonetheless.</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-golf-news-solheim-cup-lpga-despite-getting-slapped-with-a-historic-defeat-europes-pride-emily-pedersen-hits-back-with-a-rare-feat?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Emily-Pedersen-Collage-560x315.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Despite Getting Slapped With a Historic Defeat, Europe’s Pride Emily Pedersen Hits Back With a Rare Feat</p></a><p><span>Kang and Brett started working together in 2017. In the five years of partnership, they won five trophies together. Their last victory came at the Hilton Grand Vacations at Lake Nona. However, it was reported at the beginning of this year that they had parted ways. Who is Olly Brett caddying for now?</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Olly Brett – the new bagman for this rising American star</b></h2><p><span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Olly Brett was seen caddying for LPGA sensation</a> Rose <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Zhang</a>, at the LPGA Maybank Championship 2023. Once again, at the Toto Japan Classic, the English caddie was spotted looping for the youngster.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Previously, Jason Gilroyed was the bagman for the 20-year-old American star. However, it appears that in a short time, Zhang has meshed well with her new caddie. Her 3rd place finish at the LPGA Maybank Championship was second best this season. </span><span>But it’s not clear if Brett will continue to loop for the Mizuho Americas Open champion. As per Zhang’s admission, he was supposed to be caddying only for the remainder of the 2023 season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Since Rose is not playing on The ANNIKA driven by Gainbridge at Pelican, where Pedersen is leading, there was no chance of seeing the caddy face his girlfriend on the greens. But if the Danish golfer can hold her lead till the fourth round, she will earn enough points to qualify for the CME Group Tour Championship.</span></p><p><span>Zhang, sitting in the 24th position, has already booked her spot on the final event of the LPGA calendar. So, there is a slight chance that the golfer and her caddie boyfriend will meet again on the course. This time, too, on the opposing side. If that happens, golf fans will be eager to see who has the last laugh this time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch This Story |&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>As Rose Zhang Lays the Groundwork For the Upcoming Solheim Cup, She Expresses Her Excitement Over Future Teammate’s Maiden PGA Tour Victory</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8aoo59lnprEtHnWoaZmoaNisq61y7JkqZ2Umr%2B0sc2sZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWSapJxixrDBjKecnpxdqbxut82ormaZkqTCtXnToZxmq5WWwLC6xJ1km5mXoq6vec6nZK2glWK5sbPAZquoraJk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-lighty-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Lighty Net Worth 2024">&larr;
