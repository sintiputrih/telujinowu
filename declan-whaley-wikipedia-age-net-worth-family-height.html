Portraying a gender-fluid child in </span><i><span>The Lake</span></i><span> season 2, the child actor aspires to inspire positivity whilst also eliciting some laughter from the viewers.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Declan Whaley Wikipedia to learn more about him.</span></p><h3><b>Declan Whaley On The Lake</b></h3><p><span>Amazon Prime Video’s </span><i><span>The Lake</span></i><span> season 2 circled Justin (Jordan Gavaris) as he heads back home to Canada to reconnect with his life there, including his birth daughter Billie (Madison Shamoun). Obviously, as the title suggests, the “reconnection” takes place at “the lake” in summer.</span></p><p><span>But Justin’s not only reconnection with people there. “Whether he realizes it or not, he is also reconnecting with some fundamental part of himself from when he was younger, as we do when our adult life blows up,” Jordan said. And helping him do so are an eccentric group of relatives, neighbors, and love interests who resides around the lake.</span></p><p><span>Amongst these people, there also stands a little gender-fluid child named Opal, and he’s portrayed by Declan Whaley.</span></p><p><span>Opal is Justin’s stepsister Maisy-May’s son who quickly makes friends with Justin and makes him feel like “some tired old gay.”</span></p><p><span>As per Jordan, having a dynamic young queer character on </span><i><span>The Lake </span></i><span>was a brilliant idea. “Putting someone like Opal in the same frame as someone like Justin. It’s an opportunity for the audience to learn without feeling like they’re being fed,” he said.</span></p><p><span>He’s also happy with the fact that the show embraces LGBTQ personas without forcing any moments of toxicity just for the sake of drama. “I suppose someone could watch the show and call foul and say, ‘Well, that’s not how the world really is.’ I think our response to that was always like, ‘Yeah, we know, but it’s how the world could be,’” he explained.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, he’s sure that nobody will bat an eye about Opal’s gender nonconformity. And he thanks Declan for that. “Declan is fantastic, just a wonderful treat, and somehow understood this person in an almost otherworldly and ethereal way,” he said.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Declan Whaley Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Declan Whaley garnered a net worth of under $150 thousand by 2023.</span></p><p><span>This child actor started his career in 2015 appearing as a Doggers Batter in </span><i><span>LIP SERVICE: Proof That Baseball Is a Kid’s Game</span></i><span>. The next year, he then played “David Simmons” in the TV series </span><i><span>Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders</span></i><span>, and after that, he was on a roll.</span></p><p><span>So far, Declan has appeared in over 15 movies and TV shows. Some of them are </span><i><span>Firebuds</span></i><span> (2023), </span><i><span>Puppy Place </span></i><span>(2022), </span><i><span>Turma da Mônica: A Série</span></i><span> (2022), </span><i><span>Rebel </span></i><span>(2021), </span><i><span>The Big Show Show</span></i><span> (2020), </span><i><span>Bizaardvark </span></i><span>(2018), and </span><i><span>Alexa & Katie </span></i><span>(2018).</span></p><p><span>Also, you might have seen him as “Connor Hall” on</span><i><span> School of Rock</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>The last we checked, Declan was working on </span><i><span>The Lake</span></i><span> as a gender-fluid child named Opal.</span></p><p><span>“Cottage life is anything but quiet… I am excited to announce that I will be returning as Opal on #thelakeonprimevideo for Season 2! Don’t miss the premiere on June 9,” he promoted the show on IG.</span></p><p><span>Back in 2016 and 2017, Declan was also an NYA Award Nominee.</span></p><p><span>When Declan wasn’t acting, he was busy practicing his karate skills. In fact, in 2015, the actor locked up 6 first places at one of the largest karate tournaments in the world, solidifying his position as National Champion</span></p><h3><b>Declan Whaley Age</b></h3><p><span>Declan Whaley was reportedly born in 2010. That made him 13 years of age in 2023.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Declan Whaley Ethnicity?</b></h3><p><span>Declan Whaley flaunts mixed ethnicity — likely Asian and White.</span></p><h3><b>Declan Whaley Family</b></h3><p><i><span>The Lake</span></i><span> actor, Declan Whaley comes from a family of four. “I love my family,” he said, even though his parents didn’t let him watch many shows like </span><i><span>Criminal Minds </span></i><span>(the show he once was a part of).</span></p><p><span>However, his parents binged watched every series.</span></p><p><span>His father, Jim Whaley believed the actor was too younger to watch such a series.</span></p><p><span>As for his sibling, Declan’s sister Kaelyn Whaley is also a world-champion martial artist like him. In fact, she was the 18-time World Champion Martial Artist and five-time gold medalist with US Martial Arts Team</span></p><p><span>You may have also seen her back in 2009 when she appeared on Dr. Phil show with her lifesaving moves. The 7-year-older Kaelyn at the time was invited to be Dr. Phil’s special guest where her demonstration showed that when children protect themselves from kidnappers, strong little legs should be used for kicking and running away. But their greatest weapon is their voice!</span></p><p><span>It’s supposed to attract attention because then someone can help you, then you can get away from that stranger,” Kaelyn said.</span></p><p><span>Now, Kaelyn’s also an actor, model, and stunt performer.
