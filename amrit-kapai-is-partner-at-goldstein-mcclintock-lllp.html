The reality show got green-lighted in 2020, where they decoded the chronicles of several Indian-American families that entered Miami, Florida, showing the history of three generations of immigrants.</p><p>Kapai is one of the main men as he carries the lighthearted and comedic docuseries. With the backing of Truly Original, the Emmy-winning production company, they were destined to succeed.</p><p>After instances of drama, marriage, and fights, the vibrant families as still as tight-knit as ever, with the parents trying to hold on to their cherished customs while the young adults struggle to live at home until marriage.</p><p>Indeed, youngsters have tendencies to bottle their feeling until they explode like a volcano, leaving a wave of disrespect and disappointed elderly in their wake.</p><p>The constant push and pull come with fiction but also brings funny family dynamics that are laugh-out-loud worthy. Joining Amrit are his peers Bali Chainani, Monica Vaswani, Brian Benni, and many more as they found arranged friendships.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-amrit-kapai-age-has-crossed-intro-the-30s></span>1. Amrit Kapai Age Has Crossed Intro The 30s<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amrit Kapai is 35 years old. At this age he has achieved a lot as a TV personality.</p><p>The business person got his schooling from the University of Oxford and Emory University, where he studied Economics.</p><p>He remains active as a part of the numerous governing associations while operating as the vice president of the Programming-College Council.</p><p>Despite their foreign studies, he did not let go of his heritage, as he became president of the Indian Cultural Exchange, Member of the Omicron Delta Epsilon.</p><p>Next, he completed his JD in law from Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, where he continued his reign as a stellar pupil as part of the dean’s list, receiving an honor Scholar Award while working as a research assistant. The institution taught him many life lessons and sent him to oversee the Fudan University, Shanghai, China, for an exchange program.</p><p>Despite Florida being his native land, he held a place in his heart for Chicago as the change in weather was visually pleasing. He first came across the city when he was still seventeen years old. Indeed, he and his friend made a field trip to the magical city for a spiritual retreat. The metropolis was the perfect place to reinvent himself, and he found his calling.</p><p>After graduation, it was only plausible to return to the town as he packed his suitcases and never looked back. The winds were oddly comforting as the independent way of living alone made him feel confident in himself.</p><p>The minor chores of laundry, cooking, and groceries were vastly different back home as he learned to become an adult.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-amrit-kapai-parents-suresh-and-lavina-kapai-are-fan-favorites></span>2. Amrit Kapai Parents Suresh and Lavina Kapai Are Fan Favorites<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amrit Kapai&nbsp;parents are&nbsp;Suresh and Lavina Kapai. The family moved to the US from India.</p><p>First-generation immigrant adults remain receptive to their interests and are certainly one of the most open-minded parents in the reality TV realm.</p><p>His dad traveled from the Indian subcontinent with no more than ten dollars in his pocket and a broken understanding of the language.</p><p>In a few decades, he had made himself a self-made man with a career and a family.</p><p>But the viewers showered their love for other reasons as they graciously tackled the news of having a homosexual son despite being for the Indian community.</p><p>Initially, the pair were far from happy after their son came out to them around five years ago.</p><p>Eventually, they gathered their wits and unlocked their arms to welcome their child back into their lives. Watchers native to the land remained shellshocked by their sincerity and genuine effort for Amrit.</p><p>They applauded their reactions, saying their community could have avoided future trauma in only parents were like them.</p><p>Meanwhile, the couple had other worries eating them alive. The outside world was not so forgiving when people married outside their culture, let alone a man, as they warned him not to reveal his spectrum.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-amrit-kapai-grandma-passed-away-last-year></span>3. Amrit Kapai Grandma Passed Away Last Year<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2021, the world woke up to the horrifying news of Amrit Kapai’s grandmother Koshlya had passed away.</p><p>She was an incredible woman, and her grandson paid her tribute by calling her an angel. He celebrated her journey by recalling all the people she had made an impact on, as her love and kindness would live for decades with the people who knew her.</p><p>The matriarch had always been a guardian angel-like figure for him, as he had immense appreciation and respect for her. She was a force of nature, raising four children and six grandchildren under her wing.</p><p>Despite having to relive the moment after the series aired on television, he did not feel sad, as he was thankful that people got to meet her and remain forever alive in their memories.</p><p>In the celebration of Pride Month, Family Karma added a rather suspense-filled episode when Amrit has to come clean about his preferences in front of his aged grandma.</p><p>She was a lady who was older than them, getting first-hand experience with the traditions she had to withhold. Amrit did not want to disappoint her but did not want to keep her in the dark.</p><p>His parents sat at adjacent sofas, ready to do damage control if her reaction got out of her hand.</p><p>Finally, the elder sat down and asked him what was the fuss.</p><p>Despite his nervousness, he calmly explained that he was very ‘different’ in comparison to her other grandchildren. After beating around the bush, he finally told her he liked men and told him about Nicholas, the man he loved.</p><p>Initially, observers saw her shocked expression as she outright told him she was unhappy about the news. His parents swooped him and talked about his happiness as the granny melted and gave in to his requests.</p><p>She came around and gave the couple her blessing and told him that she’s happy if he was happy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-attorney-amrit-kapai-net-worth-is-200000></span>4. Attorney Amrit Kapai Net Worth Is 200,000<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2022, the&nbsp;net worth&nbsp;of&nbsp;attorney&nbsp;Amrit Kapai is 200,000 because of his combined endeavors.</p><p>His&nbsp;Linkedin&nbsp;reports that he operates as a Senior Associate at Goldstein & McClintock LLLP.

Amrit Kapai Husband Is A School Teacher<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reality Television star Amrit Kapai recently committed his life to his&nbsp;husband, Nicholas Kouchoukos. Last week got filled with celebrations as they got married under the eyes of the law, while the ritual got recorded by Bravo TV.</p><p>Loyal fans have prayed and worshipped for them to have a happy ending, and they had the luxury to relive their moment through their television screen.</p><p>According to sources, they tied the knot in a stunning ceremony held at The Hotel at Avalon in Alpharetta, Georgia, as Amrit documented the occasion through his social media. It was a dream-like scenario as they had the company of their close friends and family.</p><p>Besides, the Family Karma cast members were in attendance as Bali Chainani captioned a photo of the newly wedded pair and commemorated their union.</p><p>After four days of none stop partying, Amrit grew concerned about his husband’s health but had fun nonetheless. But the road to the wedding was anything but easy.</p><p>Although the pair had the blessing of their parents, the Indian side of the&nbsp;family&nbsp;is notorious for being closed mind. He feared for his life partner as the extended family may ridicule him for being a boy and being caucasian.</p><p>Favorably, people held their mouths as the festivities concluded in a success.</p><p>Indeed, the men are not a case of love at first sight as they dated for numerous years before Amrit got down on one knee to pop the question. They finally made their relationship public in June to announce their engagements.</p><p>Amrit met his future spouse when he was reading and working in Chicago. But when his boss asked him to move down to South Florida, he jumped at the chance to be close to his family.</p><p>But his lover had to work around the trouble of long distances.</p><p>Kouchoukos had his life set in the city, working as a public school teacher, as he had an education from the New York University, and he received a master’s in Spanish and his second masters in teaching ESL.</p><p>The couple was not devoid of contact as he split his time between Chicago and his main office. He even thought of asking about his plans of moving to Florida with him but wanted to pop the question before taking such a drastic step.</p><p>Fortunately, the odds worked in their favor as they are not parents to an adorable puppy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmdp7a1ecqap5qhXZ7AbrzAq6unnaJirrV5xqijnaukmravecycmqWhnqm8pLeMpaOlqF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./big-sean.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big Sean - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Career, In Relation, Facts">&larr;
