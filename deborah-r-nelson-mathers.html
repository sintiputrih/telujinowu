Eminem once stated that his mother never worked and that they relied solely on donations from charitable organizations.</p><h2>Short Bio Of Eminem</h2><p>Marshall Bruce Mathers III is a successful rap musician, record producer, songwriter, record executive, actor, and film producer who was born on October 17, 1972.

Slim Shady is his alter ego, and he uses it in his dark and violent songs with a comic twist.</p><h2>Deborah R.
