He's hit-maker that doesn't need to be surfing radio waves for people to know his music. Ocean (whose real name is Christopher Edwin Breaux) began his career after he snagged a songwriting deal and began writing hits for artists including Justin Bieber, Beyoncé, John Legend, and Brandy. From there, Ocean released his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra in 2011,<strong> </strong>featuring his debut hit solo-single "Novacane", continuing on to release Channel Orange in 2012 gifting listeners with platinum single "Thinkin Bout You" which nominated for a Grammy Award in 2013 for Record of the Year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no secret that Ocean is one of the most talented artists in the music industry but what remains a secret—to this day— is his personal life. Fans of Ocean know that he is extremely private when it comes to his life beyond the limelight and have gathered tidbits of what he experiences from his introspective musical style. But <a href=#>who is Frank Ocean</a> beyond the endless waves of allegory and metaphor that wash over his lyrics? What's he been up to lately and, what happened at Coachella 2023? Here's everything we know about Frank Ocean's personal life, his net worth and why the low-key Louisiana native is making headlines.</p><h2 id=remembering-frank-ocean-39-s-tumblr-letter><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Remembering Frank Ocean's Tumblr Letter</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/untitled-design-32.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's been over a decade since<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Frank Ocean shared his now-infamous a letter on Tumblr</a>. It was a moment that defined the singer's career wherein he shared an anecdote about his experience falling in love for the first time. What made fans shocked was that, in the letter, Ocean confessed that his first love was a man.</p><p>Ocean shared the post amidst the release of his debut album Channel Orange. Soon after, a drama-filled fiasco seemed to erupt as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Target refused to sell the album</a>, which many— including Ocean's then-manager Christian Clancy—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> assumed was for reasons pertaining to his sexuality.</a> Clancy, who tweeted his feelings about Target's alleged homophobic decision, later retracted his statement, citing that the reason Target didn't carry the album was because it was released digitally first, and that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his initial response was an "emotional knee jerk reaction</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The letter was a ground-breaking moment in Hip hop as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">same-sex attraction/relationships had not previously been met with open arms in the genre</a>. In an interview with GQ, Ocean shared that he "cried like a f******g baby," when he released the letter, stating that there's "magic in truth and honesty and openness."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Noah Schnapp And Lil Nas X Came Out In An Incredibly Unique Way Just Like These Other Celebrities</a></span></p><h2 id=what-has-frank-ocean-actually-said-about-his-sexuality><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Has Frank Ocean Actually Said About His Sexuality?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/frank-ocean-music-video.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Frank Ocean's Tumblr letter, describing his relationship with a man, caused many people to believe that the singer was coming out as homosexual. However, as the letter also references his relationships with women, many took to assume that the singer was bisexual, instead. Speculation on Ocean's sexuality sparked even more than as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">listeners of his Channel Orange album realized many of the love songs were latent with the pronoun "he"</a>.</p><p>In a 2012 interview with GQ, Ocean kept the definitive nature of his sexuality even more ambiguous, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dodging a question asking if he considered himself bisexual</a>. In his lengthy response, the singer said he wasn't trying to sell sex to his listeners and, on the letter said, "I didn't need to label it for it to have impact. Because people realize everything that I say is so relatable, because when you're talking about romantic love, both sides in all scenarios feel the same s**t." Ocean further rejected labeling himself in regard to is sexuality, stating, "You can't feel a box. You can't feel a label. Don't get caught up in that s**t."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He closed his statement, "There's so much something in life.

I’ve been in a relationship for three years. I definitely wasn’t using dating apps before then. I don’t think I would use dating apps now.

He edited the caption over a year later to read “baby.”.</p><p>Fans believe that the former alleged couple had called it quits around 2019, after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ocean posted a Tumblr post responding to backlash he received from the LGBT community </a>over his PrEP+ series of club parties in New York City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“My ex who I was with for several years didn’t know about [PrEP] when we first met at a gay club in LA,” he wrote.
