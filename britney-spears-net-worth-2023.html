Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears raised her as their second child.</p><p>She began taking dance lessons at the age of three in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana. She made her first stage appearance at the age of 5 at her kindergarten graduation, and by the age of 8, Nancy Carson, a talent agent, had recognized her.</p><h2>Britney Spears’s Personal Life</h2><p>Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake were in a relationship from 1998 to 2002. Who can forget the pop superstar couple and their matching denim outfits on the American Music Awards red carpet in 2001?</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by River Red (@britneyspears)</a></p><p>Britney had a brief romance with Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit in 2002.
